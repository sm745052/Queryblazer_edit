Hey. Does anyone have any knownledge what could run on port number 64200? Theres something running there on a mate's PC, but he have no idea what it is. Its ubuntu 9.04. I think this sounds very strange, nmap says it doesnt know either. Have set it under wireshark surveilance now. Could this possible be an rogue Remote Access daemon?
it might be p2p traffic
ok. why'd think that? i currently dont have any p2p servers of any kind open.  as i know of..

okay ill try  thanks. by the way  even if i restarted the machine, the application still do exist
Not really an area common for this operating system or linux to be honest, my guess is cleaning the browser, and temps etc will work.
okay  ill try..thanks for the info

you rebooted the live cd?
!chinese. Mdg2 I booted it
notice in the output of lsmod you see a colon and like a 0 or a 1, that tells you if the module is being used..  do "sudo iwlist scan" and see if it is setup as wlan0 or wlan1
Wlan0

So I just reinstalled Ubuntu and my swap partition doesn't seem to be recognized, this is my /etc/fstab http://pastebin.com/mtgcj0uS and fdisk -l output http://pastebin.com/dg0E43GW , any suggestion in what tre trouble might be? thanks. I just tried to format it with gparted and I can use it, but it doesn't mount when I restart
what's with the /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 line in fstab?
encrypted home. mmm wait, why is swap mentioned there?
and you've reformatted it using whatever you need to reformat it to encrypt it and use it with your newly installed (and presumably encrypted) home?
I alread had my home encrypted, I just reinstalled ubuntu 14.10
i'm using lubuntu (lxde) and when i log in it doesn't give me the "custom user environment" option or whatever it's called that is in gdm, i tried adding an entry using Exec="$HOME/.xsession" but it just gives an error

I need to figure out a way to remount it rw, and also find out what is causing it. "sudo mount -w /usr" doesn't work.
its on a seperate partition?
Yes.
my /etc/lsb-release says I am running 10.04 but I don't believe it. how do I check?
why don't you believe it?
because I could have sworn I just upgraded. lsb-release lies!. I'd stack my reputation as a 28 year old slacker on it!. stake. fuck. oops
there are some known upgrade misinformation bugs w/ natty, but afaik lsb_release has been pretty ok
thanks, I am coming to terms with being on 10.04

Yup and all are 00
then turn em up
Yup
or hit the 'm' key to unmute
Still not working. All are already 00
zero is zero. which card do you have selected?
Should it be MM or 00?. The thing is. It's working in the log in screen\
00 then use the directional keys to turn them up
When I log in my ubuntu account. The sound is not working anymore
is there a AutoMute in there?
All of them are maxed out and 00. Yup
disable automute
Done. Still no sounds
should be sharp now
The volume button is not even working
I am trying to do > alias 'ln -sf'='cp-f', which is wrong because aliasing is only one word, but is there a way to achieve this
create wrapper function ln() { if [ "$1" = "-sf" ]; then cp -f ...; else ln "$@"; fi; } but it is ugly ;)
let me try.  oh wait what do you mean by wrapper function

Hello.I would like to find a way to completely block access to a website. Both to my computer and to a macintosh laptop I have.
do you mean from a browser ?
ye.
and the web site is a public one ?
yes.  the two computers cant be simultaneously in the PC. You have to remove the ethernet cable from one and plug it to the other, to work.
redirect the web site to 127.0.0.1 in your /etc/hosts file - works for the Mac as well, if it runs OSX.  muh ?
if I change my /etc/hosts, it will have effect in the mac pc as well? :/
the Mac also has an etc/hosts file, if it runs OSX
it does.. Isnt there a way to do it in this pc, and have effect to the other too? Like from the modem page (192.168.1.1)?
why does fsck tell me that i will cause severe damage if i run it?? how else am i to find out whats wrong with my hard drive??

Thunderbird just keeps loading and loading and loading, and hitting the stop button does nothing.
mutt doesnt...
is that some lame reccomendation for mutt?. yeah I'm using a gui emailer and I'll switch to mutt right away
watch out about dist-upgrade though. It will uninstall packages if requirements change, and after that you may as well be hoary
? it *will* be hoary
um, yeah..  but not completely. Only for the things you upgrade. Unless you don't give that an argument. in which case yes

gksudo nautilus. !sudo
ok doen that.  what now my home folder has open
move to where the NTFS drives are mounted, you should have permission to access ( read )
yeah but i want to have acsees from my desktop. it will let rout have acsess but not my log on
then in the terminal try chown NTFSfoldername usergroup:username
? lol
Pe1o: I'm desperated. I try out now: 28 * * * * gedit
try /usr/bin/gedit instead of just gedit itself.
but it works for non-X-window apps, like wget..  tested now: simple command echo "text" > text.txt works OK in cron. The problem is only with displaying X-window apps. Running, not only displaying (if it's possible) - pgrep can't find them.
so. how can i generate the hu_HU locale?
dpkg-reconfigure locales
it doesn't answer anything in dapper...
Hi, does anyone know how to make a mounted drive read-only? I'm using some drivers off of automatix, and it mounted my windows partition?

anyone know how to get a bittorrent tracker working on ubuntu? it doesn't seem to like the way python is installed... :(
what error message are you getting?
error: invalid Python installation: unable to open /usr/lib/python2.4/config/Makefile (No such file or directory). this is from a root terminal.. the config directory doesn't even exist, though :\. i get a similar error when trying to build a .deb
you might need a python-dev package -- just a moment.  install the python-dev package ('sudo aptitude install python-dev')
ok I'll try it. it's installing 2 packages.. any reason to use aptitude and not dpkg or apt-get? :)
i think aptitude keeps a log file, and is a bit smarter about installing/removing packages
also, any idea if i should install using python, or use it to build a .deb and install from that?. i see
if you know how, I'd build a deb. Should make uninstallation (and maybe upgrading) easier
there are instructions on how to build in the unix-installation.readme.txt file, so i guess you would recommend then using aptitude to install the .deb by sudo aptitude install bittorrent.deb ? :)

and indespensable. you can now get 2 gig sticks for affordable $
ubuntu should provide liveusb images too
*nod* i wouldn't be surprised to see that show up eventually. altho ... i'm not sure how good of an idea that is .... theoretically one can burn flash sticks in seconds if something goes wrong
i think it's related with this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=336315
well I did install feisty, maybe you could try that if you are desperate...
i tried edgy. what's the difference?
what is a good audio editing program. #?
audacity is pretty nice

hi. trying to install. both ubuntu and xubuntu hang on the splash screen. when I remove quiet splash I get to a tty, and can login. randomly it will give errors about a soft lockup on cpu#3, with [gpu-manager:1494]. this is 16.04, btw
do you get the same symptom(s) with other linux distributions? yes or no...the only other acceptable response is "i don't know because i haven't tried other distributions"
same with xubuntu, arch locks up on lspci. 17.10 insta freezed when trying to use xorg based de. lspci also locks up this tty
when i use the term or phrase "other distributions" ideally something that absolves canonical.  but i understand
yeah, I'm pretty sure the issue is with polling lspci generally, as it's the same issue on ubuntu tty, and arch term. this may not really be exactly ubuntu specific, but it's the distro I want and am viewing the issue through, hope it's ok to ask here
let's pretend that you found out the exact same "symptom(s)" occur in centOS,fedora,suse,redhat,debian,linuxmint. That would suggest your symptoms are NOT specific to any disto
some background: I had 16.04 working perfectly until I installed bumblebee and added a line to grub kernel options. This killed the install. Current issues are attempts at reinstalls.  yes, agreed
and that your symptom(s) appear to stay isolated to the hardware pc.
they do indeed. my dualboot in to windows is available and working without issue. Last night I was randomly able to get the 17.1 live cd working and installed, but ran in to the issues with X I mentioned. I presume that was thanks to wayland just keeping the problem at bay though, rather than anything working correctly
sadly most users will instinctively try to avoid doing any steps to trouble shoot to isolate their complaints or symoptoms
am willing to jump through as many hoops as possible. required* :P
saying your symptom(s) do not occur in windows isn't as useful or valid as you think on the surface. It's whats called a "apples vs oranges" comparison.....in short you can't compare them...they are two different things.  that's why i specifically asked if you had observed your symptoms occur in other "linux" distributions
yeah I know, just trying to give as much context as I can
apples vs apples. oranges vs oranges
I'm not a particularly advanced troubeshooter re: this kind of issue
you don't need to be an advanced trouble shooter...i started this off pretend that you found out your symptoms were NOT specific to any distro to kinda not only to get you mentally engaged in trouble shooting but to also make a demarcation point
consider me mentally prepared
i am using 6.06 and i need to upgrade kernell so it will run smp what do i need to install

so does anyone have experience with skype lockups///!!?
Yes.  but solutions? no
i was wondering what is going on.....  is it the same issues i have. i am getting ocassional freeze-ups when skype is trying to do something....: the entire system locks up for close to a minute....anyone expeirience this.
Do you find when Skype tries to access the sound hardware after a period of inactivity, it locks the machine at a deep level for between 30 seconds and 5 minutes
yes that is it
I've found mention of it online, but no answers yet :/
so it is STILL an ALSA issue. ?
It seems to be a kernel issue of some kind
right
ok, i've tried debugging myself, and i've checked the wiki. but for the life of me, i can't figure out why my SBLive card is recognized, but refuses to play any audio. i went through alsamixer and everything. i'm totally confused

apparently, its seeing three1.  but sblive is showing to aplay as snd card 0
can you disable onboard sound thorugh your mobo?
erm, thats a good question

ok in 8.10 how do I update Java 6 (update 10) to update 11?. the repositories only download update version 10
download the installer from sun. install it. and use the fresh installed javac and java to run/compile your code
RPM or BIN?
bin.  rpm is usually for suse
do I have to install from Konsole?
yes but its easy
yeah, I made it executible, but it gave an error in the file manager...
download it. make it executable (chmod +x sun.java.the.file). and start it sudo ./the.file
why doesn't Can. allow these updates anyway?
when I connect an external usb disk breezy mounts it and nautilus shows an entry for it in "Computer" but it thinks it's not mounted and won't open it or put an icon in the desktop

hi, i have an ntfs partition mounted and everytime i delete a file it is copied to /<ntfs-root-folder>/.Trash-1000. but if i empty the trash in nautilus then nothing gets removed from there. do i have to empty this folder by my self?. or is there another way?
I think so. That's what I've had to do before.
so i just remove the whole folder or just its subfolders? I was a bit confused because there are two subfolders info and files
I never tried just deleting .Trash-1000... I go through the folders until I find the files themselves, or their parent directories, and just erase those.
hmm, my .Trash-1000 is already about 8.8 gb.  deleting each file by hand might be a bit of work.  do you thing its save to just delete the contents of info and files?
What do you see in .Trash-1000/files?
hundreds of files
Ctrl+A and hit Delete
what about the info folder?
How big is the folder?
.Trash-1000/files is 8.8 gb and .Trash-1000/info is 6mb. it seems to be some kind of meta data folder. because all the files there have the same nam. name
Sooo erase everything in /files and see if /info empties automatically.  Any luck?
yeah files are gone now
Great. It's weird that it doesn't ask to clear the trash on that partition when you unmount the partition... it's what the storage partition on my HD, and now my portable hard drive, do.
hmm, it gets mounted at boot time with fstab
And the trashed files generally show up in my Trash directory regardless of the device.
hmm.  yeah thats strange. i also just saw that i have 20 broken file in the info directory and im unable to delete them.  they look like this on the terminal: -????????? ? ? ? ? ? duplicates.txt.trashinfo
Strange. When I delete a file from /files the relevant files in /info gets deleted too.
im going to boot xp and run chkdsk
how do you make when booting i enter in mode console ?
you want to enter console at boot?
yes
esc key
huh
how come when I use sudo apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla and restart mozilla it still isn't showing flash files?

mine won't do that. it says can't find plugin
How can I take a good quality snapshot with my webcam on kubuntu?
quality and webcam rarely go together, unless you've got a good HD one
I have c930e logitec . I dont have drivers though
i guess good lighting and a good GIMP for post. minus 'good' gimp is good
driver to set frames and hdz
you could try an app like cheese
that for snap and video. not for Herds adjustment. frequency
i'm not sure what that means but you could try with ffmpeg or gstreamer
cam auto adjust, frequency etc are things for which drivers are needed
gstream-launch is it? create your own pipeline.  i guess so yeah
those are not the tasks of cheese of ffmpeg.  cannot adjust focus with cheese
i'm guessing the camera has autofocus
yes. it seems not good at pictures with details
guvcview might offer some more options if it's still available in the repos
thx.  its showing my front cam. Not the one I us in usb

Hello folks. I'm testing FF4 on Maverick and fonts are not properly anti-aliased. Anyone know how to fix this, if possible ? I tried to build it with Cairo enabled to no avail. Thanks.
not sure actually... I do know firefox 4 will be in ubuntu 11.04 where it displays properly
Yeah, I thought so, but I wanted to have a taste of it. :) I suppose I'll have to wait then.
do you have msttcorefonts installed?
Yes
if so you might want to try to remove them.  I assume you already went into firefox preferences and playes those font settings..yes?
Oh, really. Can you explain why ? To be clear it's not just the web pages that are not anti-aliased but the whole interface. It seems it doesn't use Gnome subpixel smoothing settings..  Yes, I did.
mm some of the reports I have read on this issues at times point to the mscorefonts as a possible problem with no specifics so far.  but I am also doing a search on the issue
Ok, thanks, I'll try to remove them.
how did you install firefox 4?
I think it's a known bug in earlier versions of FF and ubuntu..  Just downloaded the archive on Mozilla

how can i get evolution to run in the messaging menu?. yeah i think so cinnabar
i fireup evolution, then I fire up alltray, then I click on the evolution app, it goes to alltray, then I just minimize or close evolution and it runs on the background, whenever i want to see evolution I click on alltray and its there
oh i see. is there anyway i can set alltray to autostart when i boot my machine?
"startup applications" in "preferences"
but how do i tell alltray to start evolution though?
try it
try what?
use the application, stir and shake, then ask more questions
i know what i could do! does alltray remember what it docks to tray so then i could just have alltray start.

gftp, filezilla

which is the best, anacron or cron ?. anacron is based in cron ?
depends on the problem...  cron for servers that are always running, anacron for things that don't run all the time (like laptops)
I want to execute rtorrent from 12 to 3 for example, when the computer is always connected and I need it on shell not X.  perfect. then: cron
both anacron and cron suck equally for things that need a GUI (X), they're both really for background tasks that don't involve user input
but it works with no X programs, And I don't see them working, they are on the background?. for example: can I tell cron to execute rtorrent or irssi ?

https://www.enlightenment.org/. i have it since its very early release and was using it on old p4 box. at the time gnome and other envs were really slow for that computer - e17 was running great
looks like elementary os. maybe theyre using this.... not bad at all.
anyway, how to force cron.d to run without waiting ?
so anyway I can't imagine any reason for this monstrosity....compared to this even windows 10 looks like the pinnacle of harmony

Nope. Same error.
my two ethernet ports on my motherboard have the same hardware address but use a different irq, the problem is the kernel names one eth0 and the other one eth1_rename instead of eth1

I'd like the permissions to be rwxrwx---. I set umask to 007 in /etc/profile, but when I created a file the permissions are rw-rw----. Can anyone help?. P.S. When I type umask the console displays 0007
yes, that is correct. The umask says what bits should not be set..  a regular file should not have execute permissions, so it doesn't get execute permissions. you have to set execute permissions with chmod
thanks. So if I created a .sh file that would have execute permissions? Or does it apply to every file?
hello. can anyone help my ubuntu 8.04 - problem mounting devices. hellooo.... please help. :'(
i can attempt and help you, what are you trying to mount?
my internal partition.  can I pm you?
me too. when I use amaroK, it keeps saying that the sound server is busy...how do I fix this?
change the output device.  in the settings->engine
where is settings->engine? I can't find it
settings->amarok settings->engine tab
all it has is xine, no other engines listed
Double click it, it should open with file-roller or whatever zip manager you have. It will produce an .img. Which desktop environment are you using?. You don't need the console, just double click from the file manager. Unity, Gnome, MATE, XFCE, LXDE, KDE?. Open a terminal and type: ls /usr/share/xsessions. What is the output?

ok, then you're using unity. So, open the file manager, and double click on the image
i did it with unxz. :(. i cant do it with double click. . :(
Why, do you see any error messages?
no errormessage
What happens when you double click on it?
strange GUI is shown
Is it this program? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/File%20Roller. This is the "zip for linux", it's called file-roller and it's preinstalled and it can uncompress xz files
no
Upload a screenshot then. !screenshot
is there a gui alternative to file-roller that works?
if you really want help you might start by telling us what is wrong with file-roller
it fails to extract files about 30-50% of the time i try to use it. I'm just sick of using it. I want something that is stable

jhutchins, so how would i install grub to do this? keep in mind that i don't currently have any way of booting to my existing ubuntu partition
i already told you, just boot from the flash drive/DVD of ubuntu - with empty space at the end of the disk after OS X, then install :)
i did that already. my issue is that i can't boot to the partition now
what partition? i'm saying ubuntu install media
i've already installed ubuntu using a flash drive. the issue is that i can't get to the installation
right but did you remove rEFIt yet?
no i'll do that
does anybody had worked with git (SCM), I have issue with "git tag" command ??

ubuntu prefers linux-* over kernel-* from debian
thank's i will give it a go.
stray_77, you can install on anything you want ... and if your bios supports it you can boot from it. hda and sda are most common today

hello. I am having issues with getting my mx 440 nvidia card to work. can anyone point me to a good tutorial?. I am having issues with getting my mx 440 nvidia card to work. can anyone point me to a good tutorial?
nvidia.com.  jockey-gtk
what?. thats not a tutorial
I know, but if you run the application jockey-gtk it will search for aditional driver sofrware, (if needed)..  Is it not working at all?.  What is the issue with it?
i have an mx 440 what video driver do i need to install? I installed nvidia-173. but its not being used for some reason
Where did you get nvidia-173?

is "traceroute" and "tracert" the same thing? they both give the same man page, from "man traceroute" and "man tracert", but they give me completely different results. when i type "traceroute google.com" i get this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/103003/ - while from "sudo tracert google.com" i get this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/103004/ - so there has to be a difference? (strange that i have to run tracert as sudo and not traceroute as sudo!) i ha
check the traceroute man. tracert = traceroute -I (pings)
192.168.0.1 is my wireless router*
so figure out the problem, report the bug. ranting here does nothing
I reported around 50 bugs. Probably 45 are still open.
so you already know how to do it
if I had any belief that reporting a bug would result in a fix, I would surely report a bug..  all I see are people arguing for two years after which the issue is then closed by some automated system.
well you have a 10% success rate for reporting bugs, and 0% chance complaining here will work so... probably go with reporting bugs
hello everyone :) Could someone take a look at my "top" output here http://pastebin.com/Tpafxi7g and advise on if it's using a lot of swap? or if memory is a bit low? I really have no clue on how to read the info it provides. Thanks!
looks like around 63MB used... doesn't look like it should be a concern
63Mb of swap used?.  is there anyway to keep swap from being used? I've heard that it can slow performance.
yes, you can tell swap to be used less.. look here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq
thanks pally :3
right now my box has 154MB of swap used.. which is normal after i hibernate/suspend a few times
this box is my Linode VPS :) we never hibernate/suspend it heh

sweet! I have to try that soon!.  see if I can install debian or DSL on my PS3
do you have a PS3
yeah, I bought it back when I first went to Iraq..  it's the older model though..  1st or 2nd gen type.
what model is it
is there any way to tell? by model number or something?
how many GIGS is it 60 or 20 or 40 or 80
60 gig.  looking for a model number on it now.
that is the same model I have.  would you like to install linux on your PS3
i'm thinking about it. It's not doing as much as I had hoped as far as gimeing for my wife. She still likes her gamecube (blah). so might as well put it to work..  man, I have looked all over this thing. all I can find is a dern serial number.
its ok I mean there is some stuff you can do and some stuff you cant do I suggest you try going to www.PSUBUNTU.com and read up on it before if you want at least that is what i did and since I do not have a PC a went ahed and did it until I get one
. thanks for the site. I'll check it out!
the number of gigs is how you tell wha model you see at first ther wher two models the 20GB and the 60GB model now there is the 80GB and the 40GB model
ahh. I see. so the 60 GB is the 1st gen I take it?.  btw, how powerful is the Cell porcessor, since you can only use one core for Other OSes?
I am not sure since I dont know that much about it I do know If I had to say its ok but not the greatest but it is better than nonthing I guess

192.168 addresses are non-routable
- i don't get it.. why?
because it's a private address range.

are you trying to do it over the internet ?
- no, only within lan
is it on the same 192.168 network
- yes :)
I created a startup USB disk from inside ubuntu with natty on it but when I boot from it I get a prompt with "(initramfs)". How can I get it to boot into ubuntu?. I have verified checksums and I have been able to boot other dists from that usb
try a different USB port
ah, thanks didn't think of that. trying now
mine dosent work either
same thing, I get ubuntu splash but then a lot of text scroll by and I end up with (initramfs) prompt
how did you make this startup disc?
with ubuntu startup disk creator and a downloaded .iso from ubuntu.com
how many disk do you have on your computer?
only one internal, its a laptop
how many partitions are on it?
three partitions on an extended and one primary (or what it's called)
I need to know what error the live system is giving you, can you take a screen shot or rsync dmessage to someplace you can pastebin..  erm 'dmesg' i mean
what it says is "mount: mounting /dev on /root/dev failed: No such file or directory" and same thing but with /sys and /proc. And: "Target filesystem doesn't have requested /sbin/init".  that is just above (initramfs) prompt
that is an error message yeah... but thats being caused by something else thats happening earlier
I'll try to get a dmesg out of it
can you get to the shell on the livesystem?
nope, but dmesg worked also with initramfs prompt
ahh then you can get to a shell..  can you ping google or 8.8.8.8
not sure how to save the output from dmesg on the usb..  yes it's a simpler shell I guess.  no ping command
gaim's sounds just stopped working. Ideas?

how do i install my own program in linux? for example, i'd like to type "my_script" in console instead of "python my_script.py"
you need to put it in a location in your PATH variable, see it but typing "echo $PATH"

netbet everytime I reboot my machine, a duplicate eth2 interface is detected and set-up with default options (DHCP). the REAL eth2 is set not to.
what is in /etc/network/interfaces ?
just the loopback. If I run an ifconfig I see all interfaces I should have (eth0, 1 and 2.
are you using network manager to manage your network interfaces? and what are your interfaces?
Apparently 8.10 doesn't like when you manually edit the network config. Found that out the hard way and started using the network manager GUI..  yes. Eth0, eth1 and eth2.
no, the network manager is just finiky, I usually uninstall it right off the bat :).  all three are ethernet connections?
But as I said... soon as I reboot, I get a second eth2 under the network manager..  Yes

i was kinda reading about PyMusique the other day...
googling it
Apple tried to shut it down and sucessfully did.. for about a day. Then PyMusique came out with another to one-up Apple. I dont think Apple's shut that down yet
PyMusique's website won't open...
won't for me either.
a quote from Dvd Jon "It is somewhat interesting from a DMCA/EUCD perspective. The iTunes Music Store actually sells songs without DRM. While iTunes adds DRM to your purchases, PyMusique does not.".  the guy's a pain in the ass for the whole Big Business cartel :p Am not forgiving myself for not have known about it before!
so you're just tryin to get Ubuntu to read *.m4a, correct?.  I agree.. he's been a hassle for Apple
yeah.  plus he's the Dvd ripping guy. Not only for Apple :)
haha, true.. there isnt a AAC decoder for linux?
yes, faac. it's installed
Hi guys, I'm in the process of upgrading a tonne of ubuntu servers, and one is causing a problem. It's on 13.04 and I want to upgrade to 13.10 but do-release-upgrade says "No new release found".

I was on a non-packaged nvidia driver previously, because the one in ubuntu did not work with my particular geforce. I will try the ubuntu bundled one now, it should have been updated to something that works.. I hope
generic should recognize the two cores, so there's a problem somewhere. nevertheless, how did you install the nvidia driver?
it was the downloadable shell thing from Nvidia. thing is, I cant compile the current one, complained about symbol mismatches.. hence why I started playing around with my kernel headers etc. and noticed I was not on a SMP kernel anymore
oh, ok. since it seems you want to use the latest version of the driver (and not the older in the repos) then you it would be better to use Envy.
is that the fancy nvidia installer thing?
yes, it will download the driver from nvidia and install it for you
I will try that

Hi, any guidance for me installing on PowerPC via the mini.iso?. It is asking me which kernel to choose. My CPU is: PowerPC 7455, altivec supported (1250.00MHz)

Yes, I'm told it will work, following instructions at https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/ubuntu-mate-1510-powerpc/2506/4
When are you seeing the kernel choice, on the mini it is just a link to a net install.
It is using the text installation screens, this is the "Install the base system" screen. I am getting six different kernel selections. I can list them if you like.

Sorry.  Oh, it says something else

Hello! my question: I have installed NetworkManager and accidently, I typed in a password when it prompted me.. I just want to disable that password that it asks me everytime connecting to a network =(
that's gnome-keyring, right?
i dont know
there's the wireless key, and there's gnome-keyring that stores the saved wireless-key.  you can 'apt-get install gnome-keyring-manager' to play around with your saved passwords.  deleting the stored password using gnome-keyring-manager should have the desired effect
thanks =)
np's :)
ops.. I think it shows only the passwords for WEP and WPA
indeed, you can delete the entire keyring if you want
but i need to delete the nm-applet 's key.  i hope i could make myself understandable
gnome-keyring stores nm-applet's key.  hehe, I think I get it - the nm-applet key is stored in gnome-keyring, when you login it's gnome-keyring asking you for the keyring password
yes i think that one is correct
I'm not sure if you can setup a keyring without a password, I guess you could delete the entire keyring, logout/login again and try?
there are 2 keyrings here, one for a wireless network called "asus_router" and one called "benq".  do you want me to delete both?
those are both keys :) the keyring is what they're stored in
ewww hang on
actually mkntfs should work fine
cyD: can i do that with Gparted?
if you have ntfsprogs installed, gparted should be able to. see: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=97698 for a start reference 
Hey guys, I'm installing the restricted extras on lubuntu and while 'preparing ttf-mscorefonts-installer' it's showing me a eula in the "details" section. Which only has an "ok" option, it's been stuck here for 5min+ what do I do

I am not Canonical worker, but I think when it's tested by community and users will be ready

hi, I have an issue with my ubuntu 10.04 install. Im trying to alter/delay startup of a certain service because another service it relies on isnt running in time when it loads at startup meaning it isnt starting correctly
is this something you added using startup applications?
i added an extra service which starts perfectly... once ubuntu loads if I restart the dependent service it starts perfect every time but during boot this doesnt work.... that was @ 
what i was going to suggest is throwing a sleep command in, if you were using startup applications, but i dont think thats what your looking for
the issue is exactly this... this is a mythtv pvr and one of my sources relies on extra software to work. ive scripted the start up of that and added it into start up. this works perfectly however the mythbackend is starting before the decoding software has initalised meaning it doesnt pick up all sources untill I manually restart it after linux loads...
is the startup script for the backend in /etc/rc2.d ?
yes its in rc2.d S99 - I changed it
Question: My monitor resolution is like 1650 by 1050 (or something to that affect). I chose that in Ubuntu and all was well, but now when i booted back up it is set to 1600x1200 and there isn't even an option for my monitors proper resolution. What gives?. The aspect ratio is all jacked, etc.
did you ever turn off twinview?. it's a nasty bug that screws a lot of stuff up
I dont even know what twinview is

K i'll give it a peek.  The word "twin" doesn't exist in my xorg
Option "DynamicTwinView" "False"
Oh i know what it may be, i updated my gfx driver
that's the xorg command
IIRC, i changed my gfx driver to fglxr (or whatever)

I have 3 wireless Access points in my network which are connected to a router(DHCP enabled) and the DHCP setting in each access point is disabled and they are serving an IP range, but sometimes one of the access points conflict the IP , why this happen?
all ap are on same subnet?
_ yeah
all have unique IP addresses and mac addresses too
yeah they have unique ip address and Mac
weird indeed
ofcourse all AP are using one channel e.g:6
is that because you are using WDS ?
what is WDS?

Yep@.  yeah.
did you try to install the drivers from the ati site?
It was working fine.. I just tried to make the tv-out work.. And screwed it up.. Now when it boots, I don't get --anything-- but a white screen.. Not logos, not text, no nothing.
ok, hit ctl-alt-f2 , you should get a console
Just white screen.. Nope.. Does nothing.
ok, boot in recovery mode, and try running sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg , and then exit.
How do I get into recovery mode?

How can I edit my fstab so that swap will be used? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18274/
did you recreate your swap partition?
no. I did a little moving around and such though. I guess, in a way, that probably counts as recreating swap. Plus I've played around with other distros that reformatted the swap. What can I do?
Hi there! can anyone recommend a similar program to CloneDVD and AnyDVD to run under 9.04? I'm looking to backup my non-bluray DVD collection. Thanks!! =D

:p
[sigh] Another question.
Sure, ask away
When I try to install, the system warns me that I haven't set up any swap space.. I started life as a Mac user, and on OS X the system uses a chunk of your main disk space as swap.. Can I set it up to do that / what should I do now?
You need a separate partition of type 82 for that.
That's what the installer said, but I'm just not sure why that's the case.
is it safe to ugrade feisty
as long as you have backups in case you need them
i heard that it will break your system and its safer to backup and just format and install

how i can see it?
so i did some major damage to my 12.04 server running nginx. i upgraded from php5.3 to 5.5, broke php5-fpm, tried to downgrade back to php5.3. and now i'm hitting this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7492222/
What happens if you do: apt-get -f install
0 upgraded 0 installed. 150+ sites down currently ;(
How are you then hitting what you showed us?
what do you mean 
You showed us a pastebin. If the -f install did nothing, how are you seeing that error? What are you doing to generate the error?
apt-get intall php5-fpm
How did you attempt to upgrade in the first place?
http://askubuntu.com/questions/109404/how-do-i-install-latest-php-in-supported-ubuntu-versions-like-5-4-x-in-ubuntu-1/109544#109544. the upgrade actually worked fine. had to switch php5-fpm from unix sockets. to listening on a tcp connection. then i was getting some error with ioncube and it wouldn't play nice
You'll need to be more specific.
i followed that upgrade guide to go from php5.3 -> php5.5, then I moved php5-fpm from using unix sockets to using a local tcp connection, then I had some issue with IonCube, which I believe ended up breaking php5-fpm because it would no longer start. some how during the haze of php5-fpm not working, I tried to uninstall php5-fpm to reinstall it
Why did you move from unix sockets
i have 150+ sites on this box and was hitting 502 bad gateway. which I read is a common problem running nginx with lots of hosts on the same box. so i switched it over to tcp and it was working perfectly. but the upgrade from php5.3 -> php5.5 broke ioncube
But now you cannot re-install fpm
correct. i did go into apt/sources.list.d/. and rm -rf * the two files in there
Would it be possible to increase the size of my swap partition. according to top it's mostly being used up
it is, you will need to resize your paritions or crate file based swap.  what mem do you have and swap size ?
about 312mb mem, 490mb or something swap
ok, the standard rule is to have 2xmem as swap
what command should i be using to safely resize my partitions?.  a gui tool would be nice if one's available

that may just be a byproduct of the state of DVD writing in linux >.>..... it should be able to read fine though

hey guys, I have ubuntu 12.04 and my internet works, I can browse the web etc, but my network manager says that there are no network devices available and therefore I can't add a VPN
install network-manager-vpn* whatever vpn protocol your vpn service runs
I tried but the VPN connection gets greyed out after I've added it
pptp, openvpn or ?
openvpn. http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/827/3c9b.png and my internet connection works since I can browse the web
so you installed openvpn client and network-manager-openvpn , and received a username and pw from the vpn service , correct ?
yes but the problem is that my network manager can't detect my network device even though I can browse the web. _, and I use a VPS
open a terminal , run sudo dhclient eth0, if you're using ethernet
it says "cannot find device eth0"
in winetricks, when you say you want to install a game, is there a way to point it to the installer you already downloaded instead of having it re-download the installer?
winetricks homepage/forum may know. or the wine channel.. ive never tried its 'install a game option' yet..  or let it start to download.. see where its downloading to. stop it.. copy game file over to that location
you know where the wine channel is? there's noone in #wine

hey guys i was trying to prevent kernel module from loading .. blacklisted it but it is still loading ... any help ?
what module?
kvm_intel. .  kvm_intel
sudo modprobe -r kvm_intl
that works but i would like to automate the proccess
definitely, but when you do that it's not loaded right?
yes it unloads the driver, i have added it to blacklist.conf but after reboot still loads .....  any ideas?
are you using qemu?
qemu ? i guess not
okay that's fine. it manually loads that driver because it needs it..  did you run "sudo update-initramfs -u" after blacklisting the file?
yes
it should be blacklisted then... you blacklisted it in /etc/modprobe.d ?
yes /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf.  thats what i thought too
hmm i don't know what to say. it should be blacklisted..  there could be another program that loads it.
ok maybe some kind of lacky bug or so
printer help plz. if i cant get this to work ill have to go back to windows. the drivers are installed, but it keeps printing out blank pages

yes and no ... it asks me for a password to access.  but i never set one ... i tried my own username password, my router password ... nothing works. it asks for my username and pass
install ssh, sudo apt-get install ssh on both machines
then what?.  i dont want to have to use the terminal every time i want to access my files on another machine
hey everyone. I am trying to setup a chroot jail for ssh/rsync/sftp on my ubuntu machine with jailkit. But somehow after installing with ./configure make make install, the jailkit binaries look for the config files in /usr instead of /etc/jailkit/. Any ideas how to solve this. ?
err probably because those files need to be available within the jail, whats the root of of your jail?
/jail for now. But jk_init already looks for the files when copying the binaries to the jail. I had the same propblem with the jk_init.ini config file, but the location of that file can be specified with the -c option, which works. But now I have the same problem with jk_socketd.ini
given the chance ubutun will cache your entire disk. look at the buffers section and you'll see that its just keeping a lot of stuff cached..  well the binary may have some hardcoded path set at runtime where it looks for the config files?. can you just give it the right path as an argument?
maybe, but how can I fix it?
if your program cant find the config file it probably has a command line option where you can explicitly tell ti the location of the config file?
yes, that is what I said. The normal config file can be specified with the -c option, and that works. But now it failed because it couldn't find another file (which is also a config file I guess, but not the main one)
ah, did you give a prefix when configuring the file, or maybe there is a path in the main config file, or an environmental variable that it sues. *uses
no I didn't give a prefix, and by default the prefix is /usr. And somehow it looks for the file in /usr instead of /etc
re. my MC is ugly why????

give me a mom, connecting :)
it's just a quick test to see if your video stuff is setup right
ok so just follow on with the commands thats it ?
did glxgears work?. !canonical
gears show fine.  the module just says that it encountered an error checking the memory size, all other things say ok
then try the script from the webpage.. there are instructions there
i already ran that :) thats where the memory error showed up
hmm.. hang on.. let me check something
sure :) im just tryin to figure out what is causin this, because i just had to run recovery and fix some consistency issues (my whole desktop was locked up ( ).  ok i installed nvidia-settings now, and it says all tests [ok]
hmm.. so all settings are ok.. and it's still not working?
nope:(.  all problems started 3 days ago out of nothing

then its reading the system one then
and where is it?
Hmmm... is it just me or is Xorg running composite and using KDEs fancy window decorations leaking IMMENSE over time?

hi. in a bit of a fix here. I'm trying to install ubuntu using the text based install with manual partition but I'm afraid I'll delete data accidentally when i try to make 2 partitions out of one.
make sure you use the the manual partitioning option
member:identifier:hinhin: am using it but not sure how it works
in that case... would the graphical installer be easier for you?
i can't get the ppc gui to load at all.
ah no wonder
I think it's not configured well for my graphics card
hmm... what you want to do, is create a new partition from the free space.  if the live CD graphical installer isn't working... there may be a good chance that it still won't work after installation...
that is a worry. some how it set the Hz beyond my moniters capabilitys
ah don't worry about that :P... nowadays monitors won't let software force them into doing something like that
basicly I'm hoping i can borrow an old vga crt.  my flat screen isn't flexible enough.
what mac are you using?
g4 tower
i found a few good sites for OSX/ubuntu 7.10 dualbooting
origional relise (with the dvi interface).  anyway. I was wonering. I have this HFS+ partition with space but I'm not sure how to set the partioner to make a new partition out of the free space with out screwing up the data in the HFS+ partition.
as far as i know... it won't touch the data, only separate the free space
so i would select the option? resize the partition?
Hi, I've installed Ubuntu Gnome 17.04 > upon boot says, default boot device missing or boot failed, why?
how many drives are in the system?
Only One primary HDD

It doesnt detect any drives in legacy, It's running in uefi Yes
most system have a boot menu if you hit f11 or whatever key before it boots. see if there are other choices to boot in the menu
I've entered the bios, switched between legacy and uefi, disabled secure boot, no other choices as I see, made sure the HDD is first on the boot order as well
thats not what I said
sorry, f11 towards bios? or towards booting from a usb
towards bios, if i take you meaning
I understand. boot menu, yes.  I have - try ubuntu gnome without installing, install ubuntu gnome, OEM install for manufactureres. check disc for defects

well you first have to go into ccsm general options Desktop size tab.  horizontal virtual size = 4 the other two settings = 1.  then be sure the Desktop cube Rotate cube and viewport switcher plugins are enabled.  also click on the rotate cube plugn and push up the "zoom" slider to about half way.  then either middle click and move mouse around on desktop to initate the cube or if a lap
Could you please tell me where do i check the desktop cube rotate cube and viewport switcher plugins are enabled or not?
or if a laptop ctrl+alt+left or right arrows.  do you have ccsm installed?.  sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
I m in compizconfig setings:D.  Yes, it's installed:)

I have done that step:).  after that I'm lost
ok now Desktop category.  enable Desktop cube Rotate cube and Viewport swticher plugins
done:).  and now?:)
ok now click on the Rotate cube plugin to get into its settings and push up the "zoom" slider to about half way.  is this a desktop or laptop?

And another thing regarding paint with fire:P
if you need more help with compiz you can contact me in #compiz most of the time or one of the other support people
i was only able to move the cursore but the paint fire would not last...
mmm
i see the fire paint moving with my cursore but it doesn't last...
No idea :). I've seen that somewhere, but I can't fathom what it means
have you checked your /etc/network/interfaces file for wireless settings?
well, the only interface that was there was lo, so we added eth0 with "iface eth0 inet dhcp". doesn't apt do that by default?
Is there not a music-maker app for Linux (( free )) - I cant remember the good Windows apps, but like Ejay, just....better and less...newbieish?

I did :) No reply xD
How do can I do sudo command through Nautilus?
use terminal
Is there no other way?
Is there a way I can recover from accidentally deleting /etc/ssl/certs without reinstalling?
you can try testdisk. i guess
What do you mean? and how do I use?. 
sudo apt-get install testdisk
then?. 
sudo testdisk.  select your hdd
Ummmmmmm. no harddisk found
what does sudo parted -l say?
command not found. this is a VM btw. 
sudo parted -l.  not found?
yes
type echo $PATH.  are you using ubuntu?
yes
ok, type echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games. 
ok.  try sudo fdisk -l
No output
sudo lsblk -f
no output
try to restart the vm.  something isn't right i guess.  type which lsblk
/bin/lsblk 
ok, does the vm use any special hdd or something?
I don't think so. How can I check?. .  http://paste.ubuntu.com/8904433/ Here's what "df -aTh" outputs.  can't I copy the ssl certs from another computer?
someone here can help me out with mounting an ipod mini (vfat)?
plug it in, watch dmesg for the device created and mount it
i can get it mounted.. but after like 10secs my /dev/sda2 is "gone"
anything in dmesg or other logs mentioning anything about it?
sysrg : usb 4-2: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 21. is the last thing before it's "gone"
hi, somehow I need to run aptitute on command line but dont know how to remove the package, what key do I need to press? http://oi56.tinypic.com/4ibjbb.jpg , not "g"
I always use aptitude from command line only, like: sudo aptitude remove aisleriot
in case of mass removing packages, we cant remember the package names...

nice google skill, that's what im looking for :)
i simply need gnu/linux + x + flucbox + firefox for example
what do you need a netinst for?
to build as small install as possible
When I switch user(su root), what is up with the layering?. when I enter exit, it brings me back to original user?
su root start a shell as root, as soon as you "exit" you leave that shell .. hence being back in the former one
so if I keep switching users. it keeps layering and layering?. Lol
in a way yes, you spawn new terminals inside terminals ..
ty
it is actually not very useful to do that way ;)
how would you prefer it?
I have a terminal as user and another one as root
fair enough. you know how to reach me. thx!
archoille: how do i access and edit that path?
the gui way is gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst . The cli way is sudo vim /boot/grub/menu.lst.  Either will work, just remember that you are editing as root user and a mistake can mean you not being able to boot.
thanks for the help!
I am getting Unable to open XAuthority file "/home/ubuntu/.Xauthority when trying to open teamviewer. xlde is my desktop environment. I am getting Unable to open XAuthority file "/home/ubuntu/.Xauthority when trying to open teamviewer xlde is my desktop environment

yes, as ubuntu user
hello, how do I install firefox2 on ubuntu hardy?
sudo apt-get install firefox-2.  you dont want to switch between ff3 and ff2 it screws up your profile.  maybe monday ill start digging deeper to see if we can fix that for 8.04.1
hmm, already tried apt-get install firefox-2, it doesn't work, though I just had the idea to switch repoes maybe that would work
what error did it give you?
already using firefox3 (forgot about that when I launched firefox) but I have a backup so it's all good :)
hi i have a question. if i download ubuntu, then put it on a flash drive. .......then i turn off my computer, with the flashdrive in i turn it back on. and then ubuntu boots up?. is that how it works
Basically, yes.
and i wont run into any problems with it? most likely?
But you need to make sure you copy it to the USB correct. And you need to make sure your computer supports booting from USB (most modern BIOS do).
how do i copy it correct
Are you currently on Windows?
yes windows 8
Follow the instructions here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows
thankyou
i just tried to partition and it said it failed but it still had the partitions and stuff showing that it actually happened, is that good or bad
Close Gparted if it's open, and reopen it and see if the changes are there.
jengerer: the changes are still there, it said the errors were like checking filesystem and stuff
Not sure, but if the changes are there, it should be OK.
ok ill try it now. jengerer: its asking me for Guided - Use entire disk with a sub option that says SCSI3 (0,0,0) (sda) - 300.1 GB ATA WDC WD3000JD-00k or i can choose Guided - use the largest continuous free space or another option is manual, what should i choose jengerer
is the syntax im using even right? PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/MyName/scala-2.8.1.final/bin". becuase after source ~/.profile its still not showing in the echo $PATH
by the way, $HOME would be /home/user. so that's redundant
i added it in the .profile file not in bash
the quotes are unnecessary too
ahh okay so its a syntactical error? let me try again brb.  okay still no luck :/. is there a GUI i can use?
what is your PATH right now?. echo $PATH on the terminal will tell you
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
what about echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
okay, at the last line of your ~/.bashrc file, add. export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH. and then run bash, and do echo $PATH again
okie dokie 2 min
conversely we could all just give up, and you could go copy all of the files in that scala-whatever/bin directory into /usr/local/bin. you'd have to use gksudo nautilus to bring up a "superuser" file manager so you have the permissions though
hmmm. weird. somethings changed but im trying to figure out what, it hasnt added scala-version.final/bin but its added something
it probably added /home/user/bin, for user being whatever your username is
okay its added home/myname/bin. yeh
yes. so
add the contents of scala/bin to bin?
how do i get the mplayer to enlarge the video when i "drag it" bigger?
set the -zoom option
i can't find the -zoom option... this is in the gui
it's buried in a config file... I forget which - I use xine now
ok... will look.  i found a empty config file....  can i put something there?
hang on a sec.  I think i's /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf
ok will check
it is - you set zoom=yes
thnx alot :)
my husband is having problems getting his main hard drive to boot. he gets an error: Unknown file system ; Entering rescue mode ... ; grub rescue>. this is a desktop. he is /not/ running windows anything (which i'm reading about when i search for the error online. he's running Ubuntu 14.04
the usual cause for that issue is that the file-system containing GRUB's menu.cfg and essential modules cannot be found.
hmm. ok. what can i do?
Which file-system that is depends on whether Ubuntu/Linux is installed with a separate /boot/ partition-file-system - if not, then GRUB's files will be in the operating system root file-system
i mumbled about the 15.04 live DVD i made him.  i doubt that he did the custom installation
first thing to do, when you get the "rescue>" prompt is to to find out where grub thinks its files are. "set" will report GRUB variables. The important two are "prefix" and "root"
ok  thanks let me go see
since the last successful boot have any extra storage devices been added (hard drives, flash storage - possibly attached with USB)
not usb but he's removed and replaced the motherboard and power supply, dunno which drives are different
Ahhhh! it is possible with a replacement motherboard that 1 of 2 things could change. The first is the mode the disk controller uses to access the disk drives. If the drive is relatively recent then the controller should be using AHCI mode, which needs setting in the motherboard Setup.
prefix=)nsd s6/boot/grub root=hd0,msdos1
the second issue can sometimes be that the mobo has multiple SATA controllers, and sometimes only 1 of them can have boot drives attached to its ports
ahh
There was a typo there with "prefix=..." I think?.  That 2nd issue can't be causing this since the mobo has managed to read the bootstrap and GRUB's core.img code from the drive
yes - i'm copying from notes - computer is across the room
give me a moment to start a GRUB virtual machine I have here, so I can replicate the "rescue>" situation
prefix=)msdos6/boot/grub.  thank you VERY much :)
That prefix - based on what root= says - should be "prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub"
i'll go look again.  it is actually what i'm typing - i agree that an umatched ) is weird. prefix=)msdos6/boot/grub
That is the fault then!
oh. how do we fix?
was the mobo replaced due to a fault? I wonder if another issue was corrupted disk drive contents
the board has an onboard nic - it wasn't seeing the lan
OK... well let's see what we can do about getting you from rescue into the real system
super! thank you :)
First you need to confirm that grub's core.img (which is what gives you the very limited rescue command-line) can see the drive. Type "ls" (LiSt) to see the drives and partitions that have been found. To fix this, you must be able to see (hd0,msdos1)
okies checking :).  (hd0) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos1)
looking good then. OK 3 commands *should* get you booted. "set prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/boot/grub" then "insmod normal" then "normal" assuming no error messages from those commands you will now be at the standard GRUB boot menu
going to try :).  i put in insmod normal and got back: Error: Unknown file system
OK... this seems to indicate the disk is corrupt
ouch
You'll need a Live ISO image on DVD or preferably a USB flash device, boot that, and use to explore the extent of the corruption and either repair it, or recover vital data and reinstall
i see. what's the preference for USB?
In case it's not disk corruption, but the new motherboard+RAM modules causing memory corruption right now, when you start the Live ISO image at its boot menu use the 'memtest' option and thoroughly test the system RAM
ah ok good idea
I'd suggest the Ubuntu Desktop Live for 14.04 Trusty.  Right now we don't know if the corruption exists on the disk, or only once it has been read into system memory
no but i meant why USB over DVD?. good point
Time it takes, waste of a DVD
ok good he's got lots of dvds. has a thing about usb.
how do i mount my floppy drive?
it shouldn't need to be mounted.  otherwise right click and go to mount
well i have a floppy disk in it, and when i go to storage it doesn't show anything on the floppy and i don't hear the drive
I have a g3 imac that I can't get xorg config. ATI r128 card
is that ppc?
yep
!ppc
better irc channel for it?
i'm using lubuntu 14.04 lts, and i've observed some odd behavior. after installing the required dependencies for the latest minitube, it doesn't play sound, only video. and additionally, youtube is borked on midori. but when i uninstall minitube and its dependencies, midori works again with youtube. anyone know how to get midori to work with youtube while minitube's audio works?
hm.. need to check minitube's code to see what they added
oh hey :).  you also talked to me in the other channel
any idea how I can corretly reinstall xorg-driver-fglrx??? I have an error "dpkg-divert: mismatch on divert-to. ". cf http://pastebin.com/759493. thus I cant launch X anymore :/. Anyone got an idea? Im stuck since a few days :/
reboot into failsafe and do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg". your x server should start then

man, brother printers are awesome. proving great drivers for all OSes
i would prefer they just push theyr ppds into the public
just curious - why do you need ppds when they have a whole linux driver suite?
because i don't like to have 3rd party debs in the system just for printing
It does so much more than just printing though. plus, you don't need the package if all you want to do is print. but I agree with your sentiment
right, i also want to use the duplex-thingy, which wouldn't work with plain PCL-drvers
Mine lets you scan documents from the printer and send faxes, etc.

Please help with http://rafb.net/p/B04YKq18.html - trying to resize ext3...
maybe you should try to reboot after that time fix?
not sure what "time fix" you are thinking of, but I already rebooted like 5 times to no avail ;)
"Superblock last mount time is in the future. Fix? yes" <--- from your paste.  is your date/time correct?
no, the time wasn't correct - it's correct in the installed Kubuntu but in the LiveCD it showed up as 4 hours earlier. Adjusted it now, but do you think this was the problem?.  anyway, I'll try again now
are you able to enter failsafe/recovery mode in ubuntu and run a fsck on that partition/disk?.  yeah, if the time difference is to big you will get complaints.
yup, I can go into recovery mode and run fsck, but won't it be the same if I do it from the LiveCD?
One last question, does anybody knows if the Gutsy gibbon fixes the HP Pavillion dv6xxx/AMD problems? That's why im thinking about the upgrade...
Which problems?
random freezes. and ACPI/irq problems. not a linux problem, of course, HP acpi implementation seem bogus
Is it fairly new hardware?
1 year, more or less
any idea why sometimes my background slides with the workspace and someties not?
any kind of patter to when it doesn't and when it does?
havent noticed any pattern. what is it for you?
there is a setting for which classes of windows slider and which classes stay fixed when you switch workspaces
does the bg slide with the ws?. ok ill tryto find it
check the settings for the "Desktop Wall" in ccsm
im currently doing so
Got a problem with an HP Omnibook 6100 (my good old laptop) and newer Ubuntu releases. It freezes or reboots (either or) with newer kernels. Worked nice up until 6.10 (I think), 7.04, 7.10 and 8.04 causes hang/reboot during bootup. Bug 89892 seems to be the one hitting me (and others). And for some reason it's marked 'wontfix'. :-/
does this happen only with 8.04?.  er, sorry, i mis-read the problem. have you tried any kernel switches?
Nah, 7.04 and 7.10 too..  noacpi and so forth has been tried..  No joy, though.
Does your BIOS have the option to boot from USB in the first place?. Is arch going to be your first distro?
grep the log (to be short). no, it wasn't, my first linux distro was mandrake or mandriva (whatever was earlier) but after a couple of years I started using archlinux (more prolonged answer)
Ah, nice, I asked because I have alot of first time linux users wanting to start with Arch for some reason lol
POVadct: still not working. grub-install --root-directory=/boot --recheck /dev/sda. Probing devices to guess BIOS drives. This may take a long time.. /dev/sda: Not found or not a block device.
before going to the chroot environment, do sudo mount --bind /dev/ /mntpointofyourroot/dev
aha...
is there a way to sync my ipod touch to ubuntu?. or a data transfer wud do fine to

nope. i am running the stock firmware. 2.2

darn. even running windows in a VM wont work?
while I'm at it ...what if any progress has been made to include java and flash at least as part of default install ??? ;-). I"m left wondering because I know other distros include them both
There is no non-386 flash and no non-386 java plugin. So theyc an't be properly added, eh?
and yes I know..legalities legalaities
There's "java-package" for easily converting Sun's .bin downloads, though.
well then how on earth do other distors 'include them ' ?. not good enough. I want to see it work 'out of the box'
They don't support non-i386
why is that important to me ?.  and its a mistake. HUGE mistake
there is 14xx people here
please stop.  this is a support channel only

need some help with boot problem
what's the issue?
i updated a bunch of stuff and now i get a kernel panic at boot. cannot boot
How do I stop daemons from executing at boot the right way? I have rtm.
if this is natty or later and the service has a script in /etc/init/ then you can: echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/servicename.override; (replacing servicename with lightdm or ssh or whatever)
Thanks, I will take a look at this now..  Mind telling me what exactly that does? I see that it the word manual is piped into the file ssh.override, but how does that change anything?
i did this http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo but still not working

This is my first time using ubuntu and I am trying to install ubuntu 10.10 - I get as far as "who are you" window and the install hualts. Where it says copying files it now says "Ready when you are".

use all lowercase username?
ok will try - thanks.  Thanks very much it worked and is now finishing the install

I DID just re-boot
Ah, ok.
I have no idea why it didnt work. th1 do you have an idea why it didn't work?
Can you post in the pastebin the contents of your replace-* file
how do I find the contents of my replace file?
I'm not really sure. That is something i think you did with th1 in private msgs.

It used to be that if I pulled the usb receiver out and then plugged it back in, the mouse would work for maybe 2-3 seconds. Yesterday I was able to get it up for literally half a second, but today I get nothing, even if I switch to a different usb.. The thing is that I can't tell if it's an issue with the mouse itself and I just have to go buy a new one or if it's something I can fix.
usb mice are plug n play devices! should work out of the box!
I know. For a very long time it worked perfectly well, which is why I am puzzled that it is not working anymore.
hi guys. I installed centos on server, customize firewall there and not server ssh unavailable, how correct this?. support say return back setting, and I can't. or reinstall OS, I am thinking what is choose? Read ubuntu easier customize?. which version choose for server, I will reinstall OS

Any one here know a decent amount of lvm ?
I don't think so, I asked a pretty basic question, and 20 minutes later when I found the answer in the docs, no one had answered me yet
Thanks.  Trying to figure out if i am able too stripe my boot partition
stripe? what do you mean?
using lvm. Like raid 0
oh, I don't know anything about using RAID, I know how it works, but I've never used it with linux
I know you cant raid 0 a boot partition with mdadm.  It's cool
Like, I've read detailed technical documentation on RAID, but i've never set it up on linux
On the lvm channel, figuring it out
cool . good luck with that. oh, what's the channel. I still have a question too, related to the one no one here could answer
Thanks man but i think i will have to mirror boot which is no biggie.  What was the question ?
anybody have any comments on VirtualBox vs KVM for desktop virtualization on Lucid?
vbox is easier to use
how so?
there's a gui to get everything setup just like with vmware. kvm you have to use qemu on the command line and i find it a bit confusing
i believe there is a UI for KVM too. virt-manager, or something like that
does anyone else use tor? does it bog your system down?. has all the support went to bed?. hello, hello, is anybody in there?

yeah
doubtful
i was just asking if I should upgrade or not.  I forget where I installed kubuntu from
Hello. I installed win7 in uefi mode then xubuntu 12.04 in uefi mode. But now I can't boot to my win7 install via grub.. I can still boot to the win7 install by via bios boot selection menu. How do I fix grub?
have you tried "sudo update-grub"?
I just ran and update after installing i believe that command ran. Let me try again.. sudo update-grub can't see the win7 install. both of them are eufi.. I don't know why grub can't see the windows install
hello all. how do I stop cron logging from going to auth.log ? limit it to only go to cron.log or /var/log/syslog file only. I enabled cron.* line in /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default, restarted rsyslog, but its still sending cron log to /var/log/auth.log. guys ?
is it cron log, or cron authentication log?
looks to me like regular cron log
the "cron login as root" should get logged in auth.log, wouldn't it?
nope ?
Dec 17 12:17:01 alkis CRON[29959]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0). This line needs to be in auth.log, as cron "logged in" to run things. But the output of cron of course isn't there
this line repeats every min or for every run of cron. mostly its in-consequential. its just filling up log
It's not a log of cron, but a log of pam
I needed to check ssh auth log

hi, i'm sharing folders on my network via nautalis.
and then click on each package in 'depends' section and see it's dependencies?
sounds right.
I'm having an issue with x freezing anytime I use an app fullscreen when I'm running compiz. Does not do this with Metacity. Anyone else see this?
try redirectring fullscreen apps in compiz general settings
what do you mean by redirecting?
go to your compiz settings, i think its under general settings, check the unredirect fullscreen windows box
thanks. But, it's already checked.
which app is it? compiz has problems with fs apps sometimes.  like with xbmc you have to use metacity
Firefox, T-bird, Open Office apps etc.
:S.  afraid i cannot help you with that.  nvidia?
yes, 8400GS running nvidia 180.
can I somehow set terminal server client to total fullscreen mode?. and I still haven't found the way to resize ntsf :E
theres 2 partition magic floppys one could use to do that
whiteRabbit: so what do you want me to do?
or you could use Acronis partitioner.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ntfsresizer/ *you are at fault for any data lose*.  but ntfsresize should do you fine
White: I dont really want to lose data :E
even if you use a Commerical product like Partition Magic or Acronis you are at some level of risk to losen some data.  blame MS for not sharing there ntfs code openly.  heres a few more ideas http://www.ranish.com/part/ I've heard more about this than the sourcefordge project.  http://zeleps.com/ I dunno about this one just found it.  you might want to grab this one http://www.ultimatebootcd.com.  http://mrbass.org/ubcd/ as you can see the last screen shot it has a linux env on the full version which is also free

Hal has basically been removed from 10.04 i thought. or at least trimmed down.
SO what does the automounting?
some gnome services I think.
Is there a link on how to disable usb automounting in the new gnome services?. ive tried everything. i even tried making my own udev rule that autoamtically unmounts it. i just need it for storage devices. hm
I was thinking ntfs-config tool tweaked some of those settings
hmmm. has anyone had any luck using azureus in breezy?
the .deb is broken
heh. I haven't been able to find a deb for ubuntu
Maverick Meerkat. I want to add a folder (scripts) in my home folder to the PATH environment variable. I can do it from a terminal but it is only active for that term. How do I make it "global" for GNOME and any new terms I open?
add to your .bashrc
I'll try that. BRB.  there is no PATH setting in .bashrc currently. I'm assuming it is set somewhere else first?
.profile there is a preset for ~/bin if ~/bin exists.
I see! So if I rename my "scripts" folder to "bin" then it will be in the PATH, correct?
yes, you will need to source ~/.profile or start a new terminal session.
Will it also be in the PATH for the graphical environemnt?
or, you can change that line in .profile to 'scripts' instead of 'bin'.  you mean a clickable icon?
I want to associate the script I've created with a keystroke. If it is in the PATH, then I don't have to give a fully qualified name, right?
just give it the full path. no real reason not to if you're setting a shortcut.
gotcha. I edited .profile, then opened a new term but ~/bin is not in the PATH. Do I need to restart?
no need to restart. what did you add/remove in .profile?
Nothing. I just renamed my scripts folder to bin.
echo $PATH does not include ~/bin in the newly opened terminal session?
basitdrazor: Negative..  :~$ echo $PATH. /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
http://pastebin.com/JMDvumTB your .profile is similiar to this?
Virtually identical except for the last 3 lines.
source ~/.profile ..that should add your ~/bin .. then try echo $PATH.  oh wait.. the lines about path are commented?? they have # before them?
No comments before those lines. That added bin to the beginning of the PATH. Now how do I make it do it every time I open a term?
it should do it automatically.
OK I'll try exiting and starting a new term..  No, it doesn't add it in a new term!
comment those lines in ~/.profile and add those exact lines to .bashrc .. then try a new terminal..  the newly added lines uncommented, of course.
That worked!
oddly now that i look at my settings i have it that way.. commented in .profile and added to .bashrc
Let me run this by you: The issue I was trying to solve is with my TrippLite USB KVM. The docs state that Scroll_Lock Scroll_Lock will switch under either Windows or Linux. It doesn't work under Ubuntu..  I determined that the issue is Gnome isn't sending back the command to toggle the Scroll_Lock LED. The script ruens on and off the LED and this works for switching.
how can I remotely login into Ubuntus gnome?

Hi, all. Does anyone know how to make Flash work with Chrome? I upgraded and it stopped working.
chrome integrates its own flash
I upgraded Ubuntu from 12.10 to the latest version, and flash stopped working on Chrome. It works on firefox.
https://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/.  you can look there to see, factually, what flash you are using in which browser.. could be google is not updating the PPA for 12.10, since its EOL
it says i have version 11,2,202,378 installed
er what the hell. i have two cd-drives and its telling me there is no media in either one, even though there is

can anyone assist me by installing my tablet drivers? i got those sources and stuff and dont get it to install...
your virtualbox guest has access to USB devices now?
yes, and i searched for the id and founr aiptektablet.sourceforge.net
that's part of the standard kernel, aiptek.ko.  I think you just need userspace software for it now.
what i hav to do now?
is the tablet connected at present?
yes
do a 'lsmod | grep aiptek'.
i did
any output?
yes, do u need to know it?
can anyone please explain as why my system freezes randomly. I have tried to trace logs of any action/error/or whatsoever but couldn't find stuff of interest.. it happens specially when using firefox and flash-plugin
which version of Ubuntu are you using?
9.10.  i thought its happening due to firefox flash-plugin combo, but it happened a few time when was not using firefox or flash-plugin
Hm, I used to have the similar problem in 9.04, but a 9.10 fresh install solved that. Don't really know what caused it as well, sorry.
did you tried to trace logs ?.  give me a guess, what can be the issue ?
Supposing I installed another ubuntu version alongside another, but I am not given the options to choose between them, how do I make it do that again?:P
hold left shift @ boot to enter grub menu
sure, but kinda tiring in the long run..:).  no more permanent solution?
you could set your choice as standard, i dunno if that still works after updating kernel.
I wanna be prompted to the grub menu automatically=(
what text editor for terminal you recomended ? (I use vim)
vim of course
ty

- try the auto adjust thing on your monitor. if you have one
I don't, it's a laptop monitor
Does Ubuntu still use xorg.conf? I never really got what happens there. First I thought that HAL took over what xorg-conf was orginally doing - THEN HAL was meant to be replaced DeviceKit - NOW Hal is still there - xorg.conf too - and then there are options dispersed all over the place - WHAT the hell is going on?!?
It is unrequired, but can still be used to override the defaults
what is the preferable way to set options which in the documentation of one or another package are still said to be set in xorg.conf?. (i assume you referred to xorg.conf)
:(. does anyone knows how to turn roamiing mode off from networkmanager?

D'oh!. I knew it was something stupid like that. Now I feel like a tool. :P
hi, can I make a partition bigger with gparted? It seems I can only make it smaller... there is plenty unallocated space on the disk...
you can extend partitions if there is adjacent unallocated space and, if using an msdos partition table, there are available 'slots' in the primary or extended area.
there is linux-swap partition right next to it, but I'm not sure how to move it in order to make adjacent unallocated space for the ext4 partition
also, do not try to modify partitions on the storage the current Os is running from. crate complete backups before making any such modifications
yes, it _is_ a backup image of my os I'm trying this on.  I made an image of my system on a larger disk, but now I still have to figure out how to make the /dev/sda partition on that bigger, in order to actually use the space
show a screen shot or textual output from a utility such as parted, sgdisk. /dev/sda is a drive, not a partition
https://imagebin.ca/v/3TNXjN9pEods. sorry, I mean /dev/sdb1.  which is an image of my original /dev/sda1
so you only want to increase the size of sdb1, right?
yes.  but I'm not sure moving the swap partition /dev/sdb2 and /dev/sdb5 is supposed to be done, I tried with the resize/move option, but it looks wierd
hey guys. I really need help gtting my wireless card to assciate with my router

Greetings. I have a cronjob that seems to have stopped working and I have no idea why. Crontab file looks like this:. 24 10 * * 1-5 export DISPLAY=:0 && /home/administrator/Desktop/klove-stream. executing /home/administrator/Desktop/klove-stream manually works properly
I suggest setting per-command environment variables differently: DISPLAY=:0 /home/administrator/Desktop/klove-stream
So remove the &&?
The && and the export
I'll give it a spin
You sure the file is allowed to be executable by the crontab?
yes, it is executable by owner,group,other

Slow mouse speed in 10.4, anyone knows how to fix?
possibly try System > Preferences > Mouse
I did and the bars are all at the maximum speed, but it's still too slow
does your mouse have a button on it that changes the sensitivity?
no.  it's the thinkpad built in wheel mouse.  or trackpad, or however it's called *g.  it's just significantly slower than in 9.4
when I do apt-get upgrade I see this : The following packages have been kept back:. linux-headers-generic-lts-quantal linux-image-generic-lts-quantal. is this because those are unstable packages?
you're on 12.04 ?
yes
why are you getting quantal packages ?
no idea ... :P.  is it something that could be coming through backports?
have you got backports enabled....?
I think it's enabled by default ...
really shouldn't be
I was not asked to select the repos I wanted to have enabled during install ...
I'd be very surprised if backports is enabled by default on LTS releases.
yes, just checked the sources.list file and "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-backports main restricted universe multiverse" is there. and enabled. so it's being enabled by default now it seems ... odd
that's not good
I will disable them right away
hi, after installing lios (OCR program) my apt-get broke down and I can't install and uninstall anything. it says: lios package is going to be reinstalled, but package cannot be found. it displays it whenever I want to unstall or uninstall something using apt-get. any help will be appreciated
where is this package from?
it's from here: http://code.google.com/p/linux-intelligent-ocr-solution/downloads/list
what happened when you installed it? Presumably it was not successful?
jring: it didn't launch, because it wanted some dependencies, I've installed them, but then it stopped working. apt-get stopped working, because lios didn't run at all
pastebin what happens when you try to install it now
I can paste it here, but it's in Polish
prefix your command with LANGUAGE=C LANG=C (and use a pastebin)
it's something like: lios package is going to be reinstalled, but package cannot be found.  ok.  E: The package lios needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.
what command did you run
sorry, it was: sudo apt-get purge lios
pastebin what happens when you try to install it now
it's the same
what command did you run
oh, wait... when I'm trying to install it it says:.  Preparing to replace lios 1.7 (using Lios_1.7_all.deb) ....  sudo: update-desktop-database: command not found.  dpkg: warning: subprocess old pre-removal script returned error exit status 1
please use a pastebin in the future
dpkg: trying script from the new package instead ....  sudo: update-desktop-database: command not found.  dpkg: error processing Lios_1.7_all.deb (--install):.  subprocess new pre-removal script returned error exit status 1.  sudo: update-desktop-database: command not found.  I will
did you make sure to satisfy the dependencies? What are they?
yes, there were two of them, but now I can't use apt-get anymore
you can use "dpkg --purge --force-remove-reinstreq packagename" to remove it. Ideally you would read the removal and install scripts to make sure they don't leave junk you don't want around
thanks, I will give it a try.  it doesn't work
you need to pastebin what you typed and the full output
pastebin to imageshack or something?
what are the most linux compatible laptop brands?
they're all compatible...just stay away from the "esoteric" hardware...
I got compaq and am happy with it, but I'm going to buy a new one. what about mac books?
should work just fine, but I haven't tried it.
what do you mean "esoteric"?
sony tends to put really weird hardware that nobody else uses in their machines....  that stuff tends not to work.
hmm... I booted a sony vaio with knoppix and the wireless and ethernet got recognized out of the box

hi guys, does anyone know why on some ubuntu/debian is fstrim disabled at fresh setup by default??
disabled? can you give a lot more infos on exact ubuntu version, which kernel, which ssd, which error? etc?
@ fstrim -v shows not activated at kernel mostly debian-8.2 servers with SSD
not on ubuntu
i have to fix lvm.conf and upgrade-initramfs. no
better ask in #debian how they handle fstrim
but why is ubuntu active and debian prevent users from usage??. found no release notes on net
maybe they go with discard mountoption. but again: ask them why, not ask others to guess
ok thanks. i will keep closer look. some howtos offers infos about damaged SSDs with the usage of fstrim!!. see debian-SSD area
---> #debian
but iam confused why ubuntu basics far away from deb. thanks

as far as configuring how/
like how it should operate.. soundsettings.. and outs and ins.. all that stuff..
there is the volume control up in the right hand corner, you can select most if not all through there..  in terminal you can also type "alsamixer" and adjust through there. be care ful what you are adjusting.
yeah I saw that one. it left me quite unsatisfied thou.. I like it to be more! :)
more graphical? :P
alsamixer.. ok. is that a graphical interface,,?
it is ncurses/dialog based. its not pretty but it will get the job done :P
ok
rhythmbox, why must you be mean :( crashes after so long of streaming internet radio.  did you check out alsamixer?
yes...  only volume settings there.. I will search in apt-file to see if I can find any packages
You can set other stuff than volume..  atleast with my SB, there are about 30 settings
what kind of settings do u have?.  can u set freqvens and stuff..
ubuntulog: well, your network is only as secure as you make it.. are you behind a properly configured router/firewall?
was that for me?
yes. sorry
i am behind a router
well, thats your first line of defense... make sure your router is set up properly.
how do i have dhcp but with static nameservers (ignoring nameserver supplied by dhcp) ?

Hi, I can't find the .emacs folder on my home, instead I have emacs.d , anyone can tell me where to find .emacs ? I need it to install some plugin.
if it's not in your home directory then I guess there no exists any .emacs directory in your filesystem. You should check for an emacs (without leading dot) somwhere in /usr/local or so
ok  I'll check there thanks
np
I found an emacs folder but it's empty : /usr/local/share/emacs/22.2/site-lisp
evilwhisper; this is on a dif comp. evilwhisper; no network at all on other comp. wait a minute.
lspci | grep -i ethernet. You should see this. Ethernet controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6102 [Rhine-II]
nope
Does it output anything?
ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co. Ltd. TRL-8913/8913C/8193C+ (rev 10)
Ok.  That just means you have a diffrent chipset then I do.  Goto System --> Administration --> Networking
and ethernet controller: Atheros Communications, INC. AR 5212 802.11abg
goto System --> Administration --> Networking.  You should see Ethernet Connection
I am a DOOFFF. I see that
Click On It
click enable right
Yep. Then Try to goto a webpage. like google.  Did it work?
evil_whisper, yeah thanks.
No Problem, Does your wifi work as well?
evil_whisper, they both just needed to be enabled and set to DHCP.
Awsome glad it works. :-). *Awesome
evil_whisper, thanks for the help.

has anyone had any luck with wireless n and ubuntu 8.10?
-> plenty have
im using the iwlagn driver but all i get i wireless G performance
-> come again?
all i get is 54 Mb/s to my wireless n router it should support about 130 Mb/s
-> do you really honestly expect that rate on the internet?
no but in my local network at least
-> and what have you accomplish in such?
faster transfers between my workstation and file server.  i have 100 Mb/s from my isp so it would be nice to get at least that.
I might regret this, but. if I have two interfaces up, what decides where my internet comes from?. jesus.. how are you supposed to get anything done in this channel?
the routes decide where packets go.
what's the default routes table in ubuntu?
use command 'route' to list current set routes
can they be hot-swapped without downing an interface?.  thank you.
yeah, through network-manager
you mean the GUI manager?
right. or by the route command on the terminal itself.
I'd rather use the route command. I'm allergic to GUI tools..  I don't want to have to configure an ssh-forwarded app just to change routes.
hi all, how do i check if im using the hardware accelerated or vesa video card driver on my ubuntu machine?

Anyway, what is the best way for a manual setup?. What options should I use for manual partitioning? I have never done ie
There should be no problem if you do the partitioning.
I know, but I have never done manual partitioning. What are the recommended settings?
If you're new to this, use one partition with >5GB..  And remember of a swap partition..  How much RAM do you have?
And make the main partition ext3?.  2GB
Yes, use ext3. And 2 GB for swap as well..  (if you have that space left)
Ok thanks. Yeah, the second partition is 74GB in size
Caution with the bootloader installation step!
Thanks again.  Yeah, I will install the bootloader on the same partition
Let the bootloader install into the root partition of your new installed ubuntu.
Ok Thanks.  If I need more help, I will come back in here

Anyone knows about "Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller" drivers?
pretty sure thats what i have on my lappy
what drivers do you use for it?
the intel ones? let me see what i actually have installed.  xserver-xorg-video-intel
Will having xserver-xorg-video-vesa installed interfere with other installed drivers? 
dont know about 'others' it does not effect intel driver
I have that installed too. From the default repos right?
What should I do now in order to start apache? Is it installed by default with 6.06?. how do I access it? like http://localhost or what?
no, but it you can install it using synaptic.  http://localhost will work once it's installed
will that tutorial for installing LAMP for 5.10 work with this version as well (6.06)
hi all, on a new install with both an IDE and a SATA hard drive, /etc/fstab is saying that /dev/sdb1 is mounted at /, but mount reports that /dev/sda1 is mounted there.... any ideas why this might happen?
/boot/grub/menu.lst is causing /dev/sda1 to mount at / when the kernel loads. by the time /etc/fstab is read, / is already used.
thank you. is it a bad idea for me to edit fstab to fix that mistake?

Oops, I did it again. I think I blew up GDM by uninstalling nvidia-glx, how would I go about fixing it?
reinstall nvidia-glx?
Done that. After loads of dependency troubles, it didn't help worth amonkey.
if you needed to install depencies, you might be installing the wrong package
I very much doubt that.. Is there a way to just start over without a disc? :P

since we don't have enough information about what is wrong, we cannot have a fix
well, it wont join a wireless network with wpa or wpa2 encryption, it does see all networks, but keeps saying the password is wrong.

if your not going to use xfree86 i would remove all traces of it, just so its cleans up your directories if you have any other problems in the future

is it faster?
well I found it alltogether more, as I firstly had problems with the login screen as it was a different resolution to my normal desktop. now its the same.
how do i remove it?
this is a strange networking question.... i'm running ubuntu 14.04 i have no firewall installed, i have a machine at home 192.168.90.253 that i ssh into regularly, when im at home ssh works fine, when i go into work (vpn link betwen home and work) i can't ssh into it and pinging it gets no reply, i fired up a sniffer on the router and i dont even see the icmp traffic from ping coming out of my machine. i can access another machine on that network (192.168.90.250) just fine from work.... i see no static routes and iptables -vnL shows nothing.... is there some other place it could be getting blackholed?
forward port 22/TCP on your router to the server PC, then ssh to your WAN IP on port 22 and it will connect
but that doesnt sovle whatever networking problem is going on. clearly theres something blocking the connection
if you add a route on the system you are connecting with via VPN back home to push treaffic for 192.168.90.253 down the VPN interface
the route is on the router already. the traffic isnt making it from my laptop to the router
but is it on the client system?
why would it need to be?. my laptop has a route for 0.0.0.0 to 10.2.0.1, 10.2.0.1 has the route properly installed in it. why would my laptop need the route?
is "my laptop" the client or the server?
the vpn runs on the routers, the vpn is properly functioning, the router at work can ping all machines at home. my laptop can't ping one of the machines that can ping another, and the traffic headed for the machine i cant ping isnt even leaving my laptop. ergo the routes are not the issue
so you can ping other systems on the 192.168.90.0/24 network?
yes. the traffic destined for 192.168.90.253 never even leaves my laptop, a traffic sniffer on the router at work isnt even seeing the traffic
I have a googleearth.bin on my desktop what do I do with it?
run it :)
how?
make sure that is is executable and then just double click on it
double clicking gives an error saying it doesnt recognize the file type
I see whenever I reboot PC. how can I fix this? http://ompldr.org/vYm1oMQ
change your stored configuration?
how can I change it?
probably you have a video driver that have a gui
how can I fix this problem?
did you install a video driver recently?
yes nvidia gtx580 driver
I want to install KDE -- sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop?

Hi I have a new eee 1000. I have just done a fresh install of ubuntu 8.04 EEE distro. I have attempted to get online but can not so I checked my network settings. I turned off roaming mode and enabled dhcp on my wired connection. I have verified that my cable is in working order and that it is enabled in the bios. I know that my cable modem and my ethernet cable work because they allow my desktop to connect without an issue. I have. tried removing the battery and power cable and letting my eee sit for 10 minutes before reconnecting them and booting. here is the output from my terminal after an ifconfig and a couple pings http://pastebin.com/m16a7de0c any ideas?
- i have the same model. i have mine working fine. do an ifconfig and see if your ethernet adapter is showing
i've done that it is
check your broadband modem - some need you to power off between disconnecting and reconnecting a new device. here in australia some optus cable modems dont have inbult DHCP service. so you need to power cycle the modem if you want to connect a new device and have an ip lease refreshed
interesting I'll give it a shot thanks

ls -al will give me a directory listing of just the directory names. What command will give me just the directory names and directory names of any sub-directories?
find /start/path -type d maybe.  yep, works well
hummm.. I did try ls -alD which worked but also gave me the file names in the directories. That was too much.. I"ll give you're a go to.
could it be that my hard drive is damaged when i boot up linux runs fsck but stops at 1549903/38699008 blocks ?
it could be..  hard drives are often the weakest link these days in machines.
damn, how can i be sure ?.  its since 2004
boot live cd. fsck it manually look at error messages.
ok thanks :)
my 7.10 just died for no reason. Any logs I can read? (I think the kernal paniced)
did you notice unusual disk activity before it died? (that is, was it running?)
I had just plugged in a memory stick and the power cord when it went.
are you sure that it is ubuntu that died, and not your main board?
everything froze, the numlock and capslock lights flashed on and off. No commands worked, not even REISUB (though I don't know if that ever works)
I mean, is the system booting at all? the bios. not that I can help though, my own 7.10 just packed up today, showed unusual load, I had to power-cycle, then, that was it.
oh it works again now, I'm doing everything I normally do
my root partition errored and was remounted read only, I want to try remounting it read/write, I tried sudo mount -o remount,rw / and got back "mount: cannot remount block device /dev/sda6 read-write, is write-protected"
I remember in my old ide disk there was a jumper on the disk to disable write, but is that possible on your disk?
no, especially since just a minute ago my drive was read write :-) in dmesg there's an ext3 error and then ubuntu remounted it read only (whatever, that seems better than just dropping it, but now I need to get it back)
maybe boot a live cd and do an fsck on it
yeah probably

Point made. After installing an nVidia driver, display stopped outputting to my laptop's screen and came out on the VGA output..  It doesn't seem to give the option to use laptop's LCD screen under display settings either (in the GUI anyway).
any errors when rebooting?
No apparent signs. On startup in the latest kernel, there are a pair of messages that flash by too fast to read on the LCD. It then switches to outputting onto VGA

what are the standard things i need to do for configuration after a fresh install of ubuntu 14.04 LTS. can anyone like me to an article
depends on the needs for the system.  and what you want to do with the system
just a lightweight laptop. nothing special
then you probably don't need to do any additional configuration other than the fresh install
i don't need to download drivers or anything?

well  i dont wanna get rid of my windows. and i dont have the windows key anymore. so. thats not an option
you can delete the 11.04 partition but you'll have to be sure that that you have the correct partition selected for deletion
yeah  thats what im doing right now.  it says no root file system is defined
ok you can delete the install 12.04 over 11.04 while retaining the windows partition for dual boot
how
are you as the custom disk partition setting?
yeah
you're suppose to put " / " as the root partition .. pleaae be sure windows is not selected
yeah . what do you mean ?

hi. ok, that didn't work. It actually left my audio emmitting static all the time, so I removed it from the alsa-base line.
bummer :(
distro: yup. But it definately must have something to do with drivers though, right?
yeah, I believe so
thing is, how do I find the right one?
hi, i have a question, I have a intel integrated video card and i'm trying to fix the driver, but there is no xorg.conf!! where is it? or how can i generate one?
xorg.conf is no longet there in 9.10. create a blank one with sudo touch /etc/X11/xorg.conf
and can I add only a the lines with the stuff i want to get configured, or does it have a full configuration file?

Hi, anyone having problems with amarok?. When I start amarok now, it just quits after opening the main window
ribs, i am
Same problem as me?
the ubuntu version is old
it was working for ages, then suddenly did this. even deleteing .kde/share/apps/amarok didn't fix it
yes, mine occasionaly hangs on the start, usually it works it self out after a reboot or the removal of the ~/.kde/share/apps/amarok directory. lol ribs. you thought of the same thing i did
:).  people who use amarok a lot often have to do that, I think :)
the ubuntu package is out of date and i don't like that :'(
Well yeah, it will be. All hoary version numbers are fixed unless security updates come out

Hello. I cannot set my resolution above 800x600, even though restricted-manager says nvidia proprietary driver is in use. I have gone through the FIXRES howto without ssucess. Note that I did previously have my high-resolution working (1280x1024) but it broke after a restart.
try pressing alt-f2 and running 'nvidia-settings'.  maybe you can set it up in there
it says that the NVIDIA X driver is not in use3
in restricted drivers manager, does it say the nvidia driver is enabled and in use?
yes
it says "in use" in the status field?
yes
try restarting X (ctrl-alt-backspace) and try to run nvidia-settings again

whats a good netowrk management tool to use with windowmaker?
what kind of managing of the network are you wanting to do?
just connect to different wifi networks
i'm not a network guru ;-) but i always start with 'iptraf'.  it's just a 'monitroing' tool though. monitoring*. hi
thank you sir, I will try that one.
Can anyone please help me?? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=775132. Hello?. I can't configure my network settings!. Please help.
are you using dhcp or static ip
Um... I believe static.. I had wifi working last night, but... now I can only connect through the ethernet port.
was it the gateway address you were asking about
No.... Um, when I click the two monitors once, it automatically brings up Connection Properties..  Here, this explains more. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=775132
has it worked on wifi in the past?
Yeah, just last night.. Then its battery died last night, and... Well, it's screwy.
then im not sure i can really help you, i misunderstood your original qeustion and thought i might be able to. I don't know much about wifi.
well, I don't really need help with wifi, but I do need help with just getting to change the settings properly.
you could try "sudo ifconfig" on the terminal and see if that gives you any info.
If I click the two monitors once, it brings up the connection properties instead of the little dropdown that says "wired connection" "wireless" and all that....
i don't know anything about the gui config stuff. i can't get my ubuntu running from the disk, i am running debian right now. "sudo ifconfig" should list the properties of all the connections though, it might shed some light on the problem
I typed that, but... all that came up, I have no idea what it all means...
does it have asection for eth0 as well as wlan0?
Yeah.
are you still there?
Yes.
is there a section for wlan0 in the ifconfig output?
Yeah..  Yeah, there is.
is it configued with an ip address, inet_addr is i think what it says
SNES9X is better than zsnes..  No there isn't one...
try "ifup wlan0".  you'll have to sudo that
Um it said "Ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0"
the network interface config file needs to have an entry for wlan0 then, im not sure where ubuntu keeps that file. on debian its /etc/network/interfaces
So, how do I find that, and fix it?
anyone here maybe know why mount doesn't work same in debian as ubuntu, i add line to fstab: /var/skripte/phpmyadmin /var/www/phpmyadmin none bind 0 0. and it didn't maounted on reboot. any idea maybe
http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html <-- take a look at that, might help a little
i maybe have idea, maybe should be to auto not to none. is thre possible to run fstab without restarting

guys is there any junk formed in ubuntu while installing apps. or a new kernel
the packages you download get stored in /var/cache/apt/archives , you can use apt-cache autoclean to remove stale ones, apt-cache clean to remove all
im low on HDD space
the packages can take up to 500mb, as set in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d
it says invalid opertion autoclean, & anyways stale apps is not my issue, apart fromt hat i feel there is more space been taken by somethin
not stal apps, but the stale packages you download, which are then unpacked and become the apps ;) . And sudo apt-get autoclean should work
well that worked, but doesnt make much of a difference
what is the command line for the add/remove programs app
aptitude
no, I mean what is the command to actually pull up that gui app
anyone know of a command offhand that can show me how many files are on a particular disk?
jup.  Files and Folder or just files
both preferably, just trying to figure out how long this ls-lR is going to take and how big it is going to be
justthisguy: still doesn't work. The Xorg.log file says the hsync range is not within the DDC hsync range. Any idea what that means?
did you try adding in the resolutions into the mode section?.  in you xorg.conf
the xorg.conf file contains *only* the 1920x1200 resolution, nothing else.
and you set the right horz sync and vert refresh in xorg?
oh, the log file also says "not using mode "1920x1200" (no mode of this name)"
you can do sudo ddcprobe to see what your system believes the monitor can do
isn't hsync supposed to be auto-detected (how am I supposed to know these values)?
if you are lucky ddcprobe can detect the values, otherwise you will need a manual or somesuch
ddcprobe doesn't even have the 1600x1200, which xorg is currently using!
would you mind pastebinning your xorg.conf?
url?
does 'roaming mode' in wireless networking mean that it will switch automatically to better signal quality networks if they are open?

Hey guys. I want to install flash. I mean firefox 32bit. I purged firefox 64 bit and tried to force install 32 bit version but its saying I need firefox-branding or abrowser=branding. the prob is that firefox requires one of those 2 packages and those packages require firefox. is there a way to for force force install one of them?. even if the dependencies aren't there
why do you want to install ff 32bit in the first place?
because I want to. I want veetle

Question: 8.04 comes out in two days, and the Release Canidate is on the web, is it safe to use on a production machine?
i wouldn't. what's the rush?
just don't want to do a distro upgrade in two days. ;)
if there are any show-stoppers that get through the final bit of beta, why not let others find them, instead of your work machine?
Well, it's basically my home laptop, that I carry around.
are repos slow?
repos indeed seem to be slow
yah
why is python3.3 not available in 12.04 on canonical?
packages are brought into the official repo at their own time. if you need 3.3, install it manually.
you mean that each package gets added to the version depending on when it's needed (some packages are added even well after the ubuntu version is released {my partner is asking this})
I have a question. If i install gOS flavor on to ubuntu will it boot up as fast as gOS? Isnt gOS a flavor of ubuntu?

gOS is an easy-to-use, Ubuntu-based distribution designed for less technical computer users
but it's not supported by Ubuntu

hi gurus. terminal program in ubuntu cant log what i typed and i see in the terminal window,am i right? if yes then what program should i use to be able to log everything i see in the terminal window? anyone?
bash logs by default, press the up key to see previous commands
cuz i want to capture everything printable i see in the terminal but im not sure if this is possible
alt-p allows you to search through previous commands too, there are a bunch of useful commands you can google
bash logs saves the previous commands but not including the output
oh, you want a full log, not sure aobut that
i want to log everything including the output i see in the terminal window

i'm so sick of computers eating my text when i'm composing letters, documents, etc. i'm kind of slow, so it took me this long to figure out that what apparently happens is that as i may be happily tapping away on my keyboard somehow i inadvertently activate the highlighting feature, and with the next keystroke, all my text disappears, which is apparently exactly what it is designed to do. can i use a personal keylogger to retriev
ctrl-z ?
what will that do?
undo last change, you can do it repeatedly to undo several changes
wow. how come thats not printed at the top of every monitor on the planet? lol.
well, it is :P under the edit menu in most programs. but it is one of the failures of communication from the IT industry that it is not common knowledge.
if i go back now to the last active window where this happened (in my yahoo mail account) will this work? is a keylogging app still a good alternative for retrieving text?
try it, I think it works in all mainstream browsers.
are you familiar with use of keyloggers, also? i can imagine if i was a coder or some such programmer how frustrating it must be for the computer to 'eat' your last hours work.

Hi guys - I'm running desktop 12.04 on a VirtualBox VM - I've got two network adapters.. one is NAT, and the other is Host-Only so I can SSH into the VM. If I run Firefox I'm able to access the internet on the VM, but I can't ping anything via command line. Any suggestions where to look to try and fix this?
you can SSH into the vm with NAT.  the IP address it gets is accessible from the host, and the VM gets full network access too
how do I find out what the IP address of the guest is in that situation?
What's with the floodbot?

ok. that's what I'd assumed. what perm level should I chmod to? 775?

no. ubuntu 16.04

reverted to original sources.list, "Couldn't stat source package list http://us.archive.ubuntu.com hoary/main Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists"

i did apt-get update, synaptic now opens fine, but if i reload... it screws up and wo'nt get the gpg files then it's all crap from there. is that normal?
not really
hmm
can you paste your sources.list on some pastebin please. breezy badger
http://pastebin.com/281561
looks normal to me
yeah. i know
does apt-get update give an error?
no. i think it has something to do with the gpg authentication. i don't know how to revert it to the original
try apt-get -s dist-upgrade. -s means simulate, so it doesn't really do anything
ok, now what?
no errors?
none. well.... at first, it told me to apt-get update, so i did. then i redid what you told me to do. then it gave no errors
and what is the exact error synaptic gives you?
now if i hit reload in synaptic, it give me "Could not download all repository indexes" again
only "Could not download.."? no other errors?
i'll pastbin it. http://pastebin.com/281562
Aaahhhhh!!!. server error on us.archive
???
replace all instances of us.archive.ubuntu.com with archive.ubuntu.com in your sources.list
ok
the us.archive.ubuntu.com server is flaky it seems
http://pastebin.com/281563
are you running some sort of proxy on your machine?
not at the moment. i shut them down because of this. it
that explains
but the network settings are set for direct internet connection
this error (which i that was caused by us.archive.ubuntu.com) is simply a result of a failing proxy
for synaptic. ok. how do i fix this proxy issue?. ok, how do i switch it to eth0?. hmm. would uninstalling the proxy server help any??. i don't know how to switch it. which conf file would it be in?
in synaptic, go to settings->preferences. select the network tab. and remove the proxy settings
there are no proxy settings. it's setup for direct internet connection
ok, so your proxy is transparent
no clue. i think i'm gonna uninstall it though

oops yes , dhclient

try iwconfig
that gives. "no wireless extensions". on lo, pan0, and eth0
thinking you lost your wifi card driver
but it doesn't show up on lspci either.  I downloaded the driver from hp and did modprobe wl. it didn't complain. but I think this means the device is truly borked. :/

ok, is your wifi workonhg in windows , at least we'll know if the HW actually works
nope, same response there -- no driver, no device foudn
no device found in windows ,  ?
right
uhoh
:/ how weird that the moment it crapped out coincided with the windows reboot. really made me think it was software. there's no low-level port address list that can get mangled that would affect both the linux and the windows partitions?
use the pc you are using and download the windows driver to a usb stick or some removable device and install it on the windows side of your laptop
well, I'm on ethernet on the laptop. will that work?
would like to use vnc to help out my wife when she is on her pc and would like to what I would need to do that?
is your wife on the same LAN?
yes
have you enabled remote desktop on her computer?
not yet. not that I know of

hi all. who may help me to configure tor and vidalia? I m not able to let them work
I could try
tnanx a lot...what should i do to let them work? i installed vidalia and tor...but im not sure bout their configuration....
Usually, there are two parts. 1) Start Vidalia. 2) Configure the applications you want to "anonymize" (Firefox for example)
vidalia onion is green, i have torbutton for firefox too but when i turn it on no page will open.  i'd like to anonymize firefox
Does it say "Timed out" or "Connection refused" or something else?
firefox now says e to add an exception.  tell me if my english is not clear...im italian =)
What address you're trying to open?
google...but the problem is with every site...my router one too
All sites ask to add an exception?
yes
Even non-SSL ones? (without https://)
may u give me an exemple?

I reasonably regularly game on Ubuntu. It does depend what you want to play, but between the native games and the fact that only one of the Windows games I like to play doesn't work in Wine, I'm covered :)
Cool, I've been getting acquainted with wine. I'll check that out now, thanks!

any hint???.  I've check it...
and rebooted, right?
but it is true... it has been marked!. yeah....  yeah....  any another hint???
bug number 1085714 on launchpad.net: deleting /etc/xdg/autostart/nautilus-autostart.desktop file solved the issue
I think it is because of nemo file manager in cinnamon. really?.  just delete it?
service ssh restart instead of /etc/init.d/ssh restart or same thing?

blistov: fdisk says "Total allocated sectors 625153099 greater than the maximum 625142448"
then there's something wrong with your partitions. repartitioning might help ;( or some tools to fix it (?)
i am not starting from scratch
It does add some complexity though, that's something to think about as well
yes, that's fair.. but having LVM has saved my ass a few times :)
Some tools are very good and can help people that know about them a lot. But they may get people that don't know how to use them well into trouble :). So currently in whatever I'm doing, I'm also respecting KISS as much as I can...
I wouldn't hesitate to say people should use the default LVM settings, regardless of skill level or knowledge. but they shouldn't touch LVM directly or indirectly if they don't know what they're doing ;). indeed Ubuntu installs as LVM by default now, doesn't it?
No, afaik it doesn't
I have six older Ubuntu systems I want to do fresh installs of Fiesty. Are there tools to be able to simply share customizations of changes I do in /etc files?

not really, I just want to write once and copy, some kind of tracking system
you mean a customized install ?

may i know anyone able to open .docx file in mc successfully?
mc is midnight commander?
yes
and you're expecting .docx to open with libreoffice, yet it opens in something else?
it give an error
...what error, paste it here exactly as it shows
bash: ./abc.doc: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
and if you run `xdg-open abc.doc`, does it open correctly in libreoffice?
i can open the file if i use: libreoffice abc.doc
That's not what I asked though. Run: xdg-open abc.doc
ok
And tell me what happens
the do file get open successfully
and you're running mc as the user, not as root, correct?
yes. as non-root user. excel file get open successfully
If xdg-open works, and mc doesn't, it sounds like an mc configuration issue. mc opens .doc fine here.. The configuration of mc is in ~/.config/mc, can you move that whole directory aside and try with a clean configuration?. Btw, what's the output of this? md5sum /etc/mc/mc.ext
d3a9511c2dc35421f4aca1fe5e1d59c8 /etc/mc/mc.ext
OK, it's untouched
it is consider a newly installed mc. nothing been configure

anyone else using rhythmbox as their music player?
sure
do you have smooth transitions between tracks?
define smooth :). like cross fading?
yeah well not necessarily smooth as in faded, but do you get this "silent -> 0.5s bit of strange noise -> new track starts" sort of thingie? :P
I have no strange noise. just track end -> silence switching to new song -> new song
it goes to silent first, and then it plays just a bit from the end of last track, as it would flush buffer or something. could be my ancient cpu tho :P
which rhythmbox do y ou use... the standard one?. rhythmbox-gstreamer. ?
0.8.8 that came with ubuntu hoary..so i suppose its standard
strange... probably something to do with the buffering indeed. have it with other players as well?
nope, xmms works fine
and if you queue 2 files in totem?
hmm, i'll try that totem, sec.  works fine with totem
thats also gstreamer. so likely just an issue w/rhythmbox
i tried to look for buffer settings in rhythmbox but either they are hidden evry well or i'm blind.  yep, guess so..too bad, i like the itunes media library ripoff ;)

Well it should. I run a full installation on USB Sticks.

Well with USB3 it is pretty damn fast... Faster than a crypted internal laptop harddisk.
oh I see. so then you have to get a usb 3.0 hd in order to get the speed benefits right?
And you can put /tmp and /swap to RAM to limit write cicles and to speed up the system.
ok. cool

plz help, desperate. short: getting grub msg "error 18" long: this is a fileserver with lots of stuff on it. i've alrdy booted live cd and ran fsck - everything is ok. re-installed grub, doesnt help. system has been running for a long time, and earlier i was copying an iso to the server via samba, and the machine hard-locked and would not boot back up.
Error 18: This error is returned when a read is attempted at a linear block address beyond the end of the BIOS translated area.  Have you checked in the BIOS for any disk-mapping or translation options for that disk?
i havent fiddled with the bios since i set the machine up last year
So check it... there's nothing to say the nvram/CMOS settings weren't affected when the system failed
k, im looking at the bios now, everything seems to be on "auto".  i can try setting to lba ?
Error 18 indicates that GrUB is being asked to seek to a cylinder number larger than the BIOS can address, so if the MBR and stage 1.5 files are okay, the BIOS is the only other issue.  Yes, try that!
k ... will the disk still work even though i installed the OS in normal mode?. well scratch that, still error 18

What is MMS?

Exactly what is it you are trying to do?
my microphone doesnt work
Is your mic not working?
right
Are the levels turned up? Or is it muted?
i've installed the latest alsa.  cranked
cranked ?
If i go to applications->sound & video->sound recorder it errors out.  levels are turned up
Turn your audio volume up and the mic level up and tap on the mic and see if you hear it through the speakers.
I don't hear it. i can play music. youtube etc
Does your speakers work?
works fine, i can play music fine
Check to see that the mic is plugged into correct port.
built in mic
This is a laptop?
yes
Open a terminal window and type alsamixer and hit enter.
ok, everything is turned to the max.  however, i can now open the sound recorder, but when i record and playback, it just plays an annoying beep the whole time...
Is the sound card correctly identified at the top of the screen?
yes
Hit the right arrow repeatedly until you get to Mic.
I've done that, all levels are maxed out
Do you see the MM at bottom of the Mic collum?
I do
Is it highlighted? (Hit the letter m to toggle back and forth.)
it is now highlighted
If the MM is highlighted, that means the Mic is muted.
it is now a highlighted 00
00 means it is tuerned all the way down. Hit the up arrow to turn it up.
hmm, its 00, but its all the way up to two bars of red
Do you also see Mic Select ?
I don. t see mic select
Try and change, maybe what it is on now is for the external Mic. Plug in an external Mic and see.
dont have an external mic
You may need to mute or turn off another input device.
ah, that sounds likely
00 at the bottom indicates that it is turned down or dissabled..  Did you try turing up the Mic?
mic is turned all the way up, i dont know how to get it off of 00
Is your audio chip correctly identified? Which one is it?
Realtek ALC883
Turn the master channel down, open another terminal and type cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp and then trun up master enough so that you can hear the noise.
happens around 6.  i just hear static
Ctrl-c to stop it.
yup
Ok, well not sure why the Mic is not working. You don't have a port for an external Mic?.  Is your system fully updated?
i have a port, just no mic, I upgraded to 10.04 about 1 month ago
Well, find an external Mic someplace and test it to see if that is the active Mic port.
I bet thats it.  how would i change that?

I was asking whether eject -t worked because I wasn't sure whether the tray-close function of the drive was controllable from software on your system

Ok thanks.
Just checked, Banshee does have a plug-in for iTune Library: http://code.google.com/p/banshee-itunes-import-plugin/
It doesn't work =O , ipod doesn't show up on it.
well that's not good :-) .. I've not used it personally, so don't know all the setup requirements. Did you go though the Apps manager ? Also, there's a site i know for setting these up, hold on, will go look it up.
Thanks. And yeah I had a look at most of the stuff. But All I need is either something that can add songs. Or a music player that can play from a folder on the ipod touch.
Have a read of this one: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9266
Will do thanks..  I dont have windows =P , but gtkpod might work.
its sounds like it's a mount / umount issue if it's not beeing seen by USB. when you plug it in, cna you go to Places >> and see it listed there ?
I can see the ipod touch , get into it and everything.. But to get the music showing in the default player , you need to edit the database.

hello, i hard-rebooted my machine and now when it boots my keyboard (apple keyboard) doesn't work and my resolution is really messed it's set to 896x something. i ran fsck and it didn't show fs corruption. if i boot from recovery mode to normal boot then my resolution is fine but i boot directly to ubuntu the output is garbled ?
when you say "hard rebooted" you mean you cut power?
i pressed the power button on the machine
:O. don't do that
e.g. held it for a couple of seconds, since the machine wasn't responsive.  yeah, in hindsight this was a really stupid decision .. .

Greetings. I've been having some issues with my Ubuntu box after upgrading to 11.10. Specifically, /var/run seems to have changed to /run, and some old scripts are still pointing there. Is this a familiar problem for anyone?. Not yet, almo. But it's christmas, some go crazy around then too. :P
RE: /var/run being moved. there might be a better fix out there but you could just make "/var/run" a symlink to "/run". or vice versa
Yeah, I'm thinking of that, but something tends to make my neckhairs stand a bit on end about doing it, for some reason. I faintly remember something about "Don't do this" being told me at some point.
I always prepend my advice with disclaimers (unless explicitly told myself to do it at one point) for a reason.. because somehow someone always has a better way
Hee. ;)
Hi. I would like to launch the following command with a launcher, what exactly do I have to enter in the fields?: export MATLAB_JAVA=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre && matlab &
for my own, I would have past those line in a file name run_matlab.sh for example, giving it the x right for user (chmod u+x file), and then link this file for the launcher.  maybe adding a line "#!/bin/bash" as a first line of the file could help too
what would the text for the sh file look like? i'm not into scripting... i suppose first line as you just said and second line just as my command with out the & at the end?
are there any other desktop environments for linux besides gnome and kde. as well as the lxde xfce ones

I bought an X1 Carbon ( 2017 ) and installed Ubunutu on it which works great but when i shutdown the system it remains in a somewhat strange state - everything is off but the power indicator still shows that it would be running - and i cannot turn it back on again either ( i have to hold down the power button to cut the power and then restart )
did you try sudo halt -p
no - is that worth a shot ?
just as a test what system does.  also try F1 at shutdown process to see text based, whats happening
alright will do that and report back :P
good luck
it does the same and unfortunatly i could not see any textoutputs.  switched off quiet splash and now i got a output
aha

Does anybody know a working driver for Radeon HD 8***
fglrx?
brightness doesn't work :S. it's stuck at max
I think thats not a driver issue...
acpi_backlight=vendor doesn't seem to work, can't use the Fn keys.  what's the issue then?
is it a desktop?
nope, a laptop. Acer Aspire V5 122P
is it a Dual/Hybrid graphics laptop?
integrated graphics
what driver are you using?
right now fglrx. I've tried fglrx-updates and the one from AMD's website, both didn't make any changes :S
AFAIK using the AMD propritary driver fixes the brightness control issue.... are you using the latest supported kernel? what is the version of fglrx?
err, how do I check which version of fglrx I have?. nevermind, forgot about ccc. ccc says 13.35.1005

afternoon all i have a quick question if someone has an answer. i need to delete a file located in .mozilla/firefox/j6cd7xgt.default called "lock" but i can not figure out how. any help?
sudo rm "//something//.mozilla/firefox/j6cd7xgt.default/lock". But be very careful!
i tried that and it says no such file or dir. even though i can navigate to it
what's the exact path?.  Just to make sure, you do know his will delete all the settings in the default profile for firefox?
/home/.mozilla/firefox/j6cd7xgt.default/lock.  i read it will only unlock it so i can use default again
try "sudo rm ./.mozilla/firefox/j6cd7xgt.default/lock"
i cant sign on because it says that default is in use
OK
i will try that and brb thanks
OK. np
http://pastebin.ca/32000
OK.  It's "./.mozilla/firefox/j6cd7xgt.default/lock"
i need to get my default user back for all my fav's passwords etc. and i read that deleting that will unlock firefox so that i can sign back in under default

whats loco?
what country are you in?

how do i completely remove windows and resize my ubuntu partition to use full disk?. without re installing ubuntu
may I pm you?
yeah
well, anyways, my transmission isn't seeding, and someone told me that I should forward a port. I didn't even know what a port was, so I look at some manuals. and it says I need a static IP address?. But I can't even figure out how to create a static IP address...because what I've found doesn't even work
you should right now the name servers in resolv.conf "cat /etc/resolv.conf" to see them, then right click on the network icon in the panel and edit the settings for eth0 if you're using a wired connection, there is an option in there for static somewhere. s/right/write. s/now/down
zykes-, nameserver 192.168.1.1 ...also, I'm on a wireless connection.  that was supposed to be for you
that makes things easy then, it's your router.  can you right click on the network icon on panel and find the settings for your wireless?
I'm there
see a IPv4 Settings tab?
yes, 
Method dropdown for Manual
then I just add an IP address? off the top of my head?. I'm there 
it will have to be a 192.168.1.X where X is the machine IP.  netmask will be 255.255.255.0 - and gateway 192.168.1.1
so this IP would only apply for my laptop?
yes
how do I find X?
make it up 35 for example
two digits, though?
1-254 are valid 
alright,  , did it
in a terminal try "sudo service networking restart" but it will disconnect you from IRC here!!!
what will this do? Also...is this also how I can change the password to the wifi router?
if it doesn't work - set the network back to DHCP/automatic
I know it probably isn't
it will restart your networking and thus switch to your new static settings.  password router - dunno depends on your router
restart: Unknown instance:
are you using karmic?

I am trying to mount to the desktop ../dev/sda1 which is Ubuntu 16.04 I get the following result..https://pastebin.com/Rx6A9kQd..Any suggestions. The pastebin should be https://pastebin.com/VSBHxnvf
?? it says that sda1 is already mounted . What is the issue ?
bash.  It is not showing on the desktop like the other /dev/sda3
That depends on how it is mounted . see how from ' cat /proc/mounts ' .
/dev/sda.  https://pastebin.com/87rx9viQ.  /sda3 mounted /media/user/uuid
Again, what is the issue ? Be aware that sda1 is mounted from the /etc/fstab file .
https://pastebin.com/N8ctNnSt sda3 another program show up on the desktop sda1 does not.  /sda3 shows up as 37 gb volume icon

Okay.. anyone help with this one: My video card in this server is seriously low end.. 2d graphics.. really need to keep graphics minimal.. What boot flags do i set? And am I setting them correctly before booting by hitting F6 and setting to expert mode and then adding in string to the boot options?
You running X in server?
running X?
I'd prefer to keep it console enviroment only, no graphical desktop at all. Easier with low end hardware
ya I would. How do i do that?
Just choose during installation not to install it. as far as I remember, ubuntu-server installation doesn't even try install it.
No I didnt. Nothing installed. Cant get to install screen. I get the ubuntu boot (1st screen when booting from CD) and then black screen no matter what I do to proceed
Hmmh, download yourself the ubuntu-server image and install it in expert mode, doesn't have so much grahics
I've run Ubuntu Server like a pro in VM enviroments, but this is my first physical box
but your problem sounds more like broken cd :D
second time I've heard the broken CD bit tonight.. I'm installing from a DVD that I burnt.. downloaded image matches checksum
checksum match doesn't mean the disk itself wouldn't be broken or the diskreader. Since you said that server has so crappy graphics card, have to ask : does it even have a dvd-reader or just cd?
I burnt with mac.. let it verify and everything. I'll try again tho. It has DVD reader :)
any other optimisations for 10.04 on a netbook? gnome/openbox, powertop, ssd

Hello, I rescued the hard disk from a dead machine and am trying to recover my ecryptfs home partition, but am running into some unexpected difficulties.. I ran ecryptfs-recover-private and got INFO: Success! Private data mounted at [/tmp/ecryptfs.orDMsELX].. But then at that location there's just Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop and friends there, instead of my actual data.
is there a Exec= line in that desktop file?
Exec=/usr/bin/ecryptfs-mount-private
i'm pretty sure that you need to run that command. you are not in a graphical DE ?.  those .desktop files describe an icon
I'm on the command line and I already ran that command.
oh you said you ran ecryptfs-recover-private
I did. And then I went to the directory that it created, and Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop was in it.
Anyone have any suggestions for why an ubuntu box would take 1 min+ to accept a correct password from the command line?
Is the hard disk spinning a lot?
no more than normal as far as I can tell
What about CPU?
it will reject an incorrect password almost immediately. but if it's a correct one, it will take a solid minute. cpu is normal too, less than 5%
hmm... It's probably the login, then, rather than accepting the password
once it finally logs in, it says "Failed to add entry for user myusername". which is an error message I haven't been able to find much out on yet. all of the stuff I'm finding on it has to do with SAMBA, and I'm not using that, nor do I have it configured
strange.... That's a message from samba..  Probably something to do with the Samba PAM module..  Try this first though... If you type "bash", does it take as long as logging in?
Well, once you re-enforced that it was samba, I removed samba (it apparently was somehow installed after all) and it looks like that's fixed it
Nice
that's what I get for not covering my bases
You need samba though?
not particularly. I'm running a file server on this box, but I don't have any windows boxes. nor am I sure the time will ever come

ps auxxxxxx and grep for the running xfce process, lets attach to it using strace -c -p [pid] and then use the menu. Lets see where it looks at there..  It is going to be later today until I get time to deploy this local, baby wakes in 10min or so.
OK will do.  Should I attach to the xfce-panel or xfce-session?
try the panel first, I am assuming.. yay, drm.. wait for html5
Here the panel attach (I just clicked on the apps menu, and opened a submenu0.  I'm going to try to attach to the xfce4 session, and I'll paste that too
okie, cool
Here's when attached to the session: http://pastebin.com/cjPgAWvr

Block size alignment optimizes the use of blocks by preventing using, say, 1.0001 blocks (two blocks) to store data

Hello everyone. Here's my question --> How does one create in Ubuntu a virtual USB Flash Drive (mounted as a virtual USB device) ?
Install the extpack for Virtualbox at first.
already done :-)
Then make sure your user is added to the vboxusers group.
also already done :-)
I'm trying to create a FreeDOS USB bootdisk using UNetbootin but I'm not sure which drive is my flash drive. My only option is /dev/sdb1... does that sound right?
do you have a hd
my dist. is installed on an HD
If your hd is sda and you have no other volumes, that should be right
sda = ?
What do you see if you do an ls /dev/sd*
/dev/sda /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda5 /dev/sdb /dev/sdb1
yeah, so I'd guess that sda1-5 are your HD, and sdb1 would be the flash drive
good enough for me... here goes ;)
If you're running desktop gnome you should be able to figure it out from running mount -l
you nailed it. Thanks much

mm.. is there a way to cancel a scroll action?. unfortunately i'm not able to find an answer.. when i click on the knob of a scrollbar and drag it. but then i want to return to the original position.. i can remember in windows it was (probably still is) possible to cancel the scroll by dragging the mouse cursor away from the scroll bar.
Interesting - Have never had a problem with that
mm.. you mean you never needed this feature? sometimes i just want to scroll to a different position just for a short while to look something up. but then i want to return immediately without having to search for the original position.

Hi there .. I am trying to configur my monitors (dual display) and I've followed numeruos guides with no luck. I just recently updated Ubuntu after a ~5 month hiatus. Has anything changed in the dual screen front?
depends, what graphics card do you have?
an amd. I've noticed more people have trouble with ATI cards. Sorry, meant to say ATI :)
good luck. I'm on ATI, I have dual monitors working, but it took me 3 solid weeks and quite literally breaking my xorg.conf to do it
haha. :/. ...Share your xorg? :p. I have two LCD's, one is bigger then the other (wide screen) .. if atleast for now I could get the resolutions correct (right now the widescreen is kind of wonky) then that'll work until I get dual working
I can give you my xorg, but part of the config is in the Catalyst Control center, and you have to reset the thing every boot. Plus, it only works with one orientation, and with 1280x800 + 1280x1024 resolutions.  to be perfectly honest, I'm STILL not sure how I got it working
ah well then it's probably best you not share and confuse me. haha. So you're using which drivers?
the restricted ones, the ones that do 3d well
Cause I tried using the other ones...err can't remember name atm, but they made my card constantly run the fan even with nothing happening so that kind of sucked
envy?
Nah..started with an 'f'. (that's helpful eh?)

i checked user/bin, i still cannot find the executable for it googleearth. Synaptic Package manager says i have it installed but it is not in any of my applications
try ls /usr/bin/*earth*
Marcelo: I am getting no such file or directory. even ls user/bin does not work
it almost certainly means you have not installed it. Try to download it from the google web site and install from command line, i have already done that.
I will give that a shot. Thanks

I checked md5 sum of iso. it was valid. didnt check md5 of burned CD. but this was my 3rd CD since the morning
do you have the beta 2 version released this morning ?

: lemme see
is there a text based installer on that cd ?

Hey, you know in Spain, 12 midnight is 12pm, but in Scotland, 12 midnight is 12am
!offtopic > . lol
ffs.  don't send that thing to me again
I'm back, new problems. I just added a new disk to my LVM, everything seemed fine, went to reboot, and now the server locks up every time I try to boot it. I'm getting "BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 22s! [python:1423]". "PID: 1423 Comm: python Tainted: G D L 4.4.0-81-generic #104-Ubuntu". I'm at a loss for why this would happen or be related. But after I successfully added the disk and rebooted, my internet went down for a few seconds, and when it came back I've been having this issue trying to get it to boot.. Occasionally I can get it to the login, but then within a second or two it immediately goes into these NMI watchdog errors
see above a few lines. Apply Windows method. JK i'd help if I even knew what NMI was.... just in case you needed a laugh. I know I do/did.
Yeah, I'm just at a loss for where to ever start trying to fix this. Aside from the timing of how things happened, I can't see at all why any of it would be related..
what good are the 12.04-3 checksums if they never match what you download?
if they're not matching then there's something wrong with your 12.04.3 iso or you're reading the wrong checksum
I've downloaded it several times from several different sources. the checksum is always the same when I run it but it does not match what's on ubuntu's site.. c1feb9cc948bbaedec5765e39ae65c6f *ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso. vs. e2da0d5ac2ab8bedaa246869e30deb71 *ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
where are you downloading the iso from?
ubuntu, and argonne national lab.. http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/
ubuntu might be redirecting you to that server if its the closest.
I picked argonne by hand from the mirror list.. I'm running the checksums for the 64 bit iso on a 32 bit machine. That shouldn't make a difference/
what is difference between kicking and kickban a user?
if they're banned they cant come back. generally for 24 hours. unless its someone extremely problematic
Was it about kick or kickban?

So, what about kickban?
hi all, is it possible to use 4 GB of ram on 32 bit ubuntu on my core 2 duo? currently i can only see 3 GB detected, can the kernel be recompiled to see the full 4 GB?

Morning, my pc has been a bit weird over about the past 2 days, startup is taking longer and the time it takes GDM to start is considerably longer, and just now on this boot i got "filestystem has been mounted more than 30 times without being checked". Any ideas why at all?
and you think that message has something to do with your gdm problem?
i have no idea, i mean it just hung for a few seconds while i removed openssh-server, it never did that before. somethings just not right with it. heh
open a terminal, run the command 'dmesg' and put all of the output in a pastebin
http://rafb.net/paste/results/aQI3tW59.html
it's more likely to be related to vmware than anything else
i would like to know what the "filesystem has been mounted more than 30 times without being checked, check forced"
it means exactly what it says
well it was working fine till someone in here told me to stop vmware while trying to write dvds/cds.  then the result of that was "non-contigous 13.1%" or something like that, it had them words
http://paste.ubuntu.com/530744/ <--- thanx
what do you want us to do with that
that's the problem i got from updating :) i get rid of the gpg badsig error that's the only thing left....
beccause that repo wont allow you to use it, so you need to remove it
how? i dont know where it went...so got no idea on that...mind to help?

yes, indeed.
crap my vnc into my friends linux box died, i'm afraid someone else wil have to help. sorry :(
thanks anyway. I have a sneaking suspicion I'm missing some essential packages. I'll figure it out.
quick thought, try: stat /usr/bin/X11/X (or something in that area)
good idea.
question: i know that "tab" key can be use to iterate the various element of a window, what's the key to iterate in reverse ordre?. just imagin you have to live without a mouse, like I am for the moment...

tar -I 'gzip -9' -cvf file.tar.gz /path/to/directory <-- is it someway to tell it to pack one folder path up?. so if its in "/home/my/project/css" <--- its go to "/home/my/project" and pack it
-C flag
i dont fallow?. it just change directory. or -C .. ?
`man tar` look for the -C flag.  or are you asking something else?
yeh i have look at it. yes if it could change the path automatic backwords or other way around. as it know where it exacuted so
'automatic backwards'?
yes like tar /home/my/project/css .. <-- will tell it to actully pack /home/my/project/
how would tar know to do that?.  that's incredibly specific to your use-case, it sounds lke.  so write a wrapper script
well, it know where its executed right?. or does it never know what the current path is
you are askign to change the default bheavior of tar.  it makes no sense
what you get my point?

does anyone know of a advanced 'tree' command or tool/program that can create HTML pages with directory structures that can be opened and closed. I know the tree command can do HTML pages, but i cant make it create a directory structure that i can brows (eg. open and close folders, some sort of javascript stuff)

Hey. I am getting a wrong fs type, bad option, superblock on /dev/sda1
and how/when did that happen?. Does your disk work if you boot from a live cd?
I was trying to copy things using basicley. its in digital ocean. I had 2TB of images there . (total 4tb) images were important. i checked fsck -N /dev/sda1
I don't know what basicley is and I'm not using digital ocean. What did fsck reply?
it says fsck.ext4 /dev/sda1. i wanted to pkill basicley it didnt work . so I restarted it. after restart everything is gone

any mac-linux people here?. is there a way to burn iso on a mac?. gparted, erase and formate
was that to me ?
sorry yes
whhats this gparted thing? can you go a bit more step by step or give me a guide to follow ?.  ?
gparted is a partitioning tool, it is there in the live CDs on Ubuntu and Linux, but can be downloaded an burned for separate boot up cd too
i can use that even if i used the "install on windows" thing ?
yes.  but you might have to fuzz a bit with grub
silverarow, and theres no other way with wubi? just want to make sure before i go out and find my usb or a cd haha
there might be, do you have a windows recovery cd? At least it can erase and reformate with ntfs file system
annyone has experience with WINE ?
well some
oke  , can u help me with it ?
Hi all. If anyone can help, I posted this question on the KDE forums earlier this morning: https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=130435. basically, a setting somewhere in KDE is grabbing the key combination CTRL+SPACE. But I want to use that combo for an application.
The KDE shortcuts menu should probably have it listed somewhere.  you can most likely disable it there.  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=333176.  last comment in that bug looks like a fix
thanks. checking the bugreport now. omg. thank goawd it's not just me
There are potentially dozens of emacs user affected by this bug.. maybe even in the triple digits.
yeah, that's my issue. I need that keybind for emacs. I can't find the setting for the keybinding though. I'm looking at 'settings'->'configure Input Actions' and also 'settings'->'standard keyboard shortcuts'
I can't help you there, but there were a few threads that all came to that same fix.
I'm sure it's probably the same issue. But that bugreport is from 2014
http://askubuntu.com/questions/243639/ctrlspace-has-been-bound-to-invoke-some-input-method-and-does-not-work-in-ema.  that one has a screenshot and a few other notes
found it! The final comment in that thread said to run something called 'ibus-setup. ibus-setup gave me a gui with tabs and options.. and I've got ctrl+space back!. \o/
Yeah, heh, I thought I had mentioned the final comment.
I bet you did.

Is there any way to reinstall the networking part from the install disk?
making wireless work is usually not easier than making wired work. But in any case, you should try setting all of your interfaces (eth0 and eth1) to use dhcp. That way you're sure that the one thats connected is actually configured properly
what troubles me is that I don't even get a chance to config the wireless interface..  what troubles me is that I don't even get a chance to config the wireless interface.
how do I fetch the packages from the repos without installing them ?
apt-get --download-only install <pkgname>.  man apt-get
same as apt-get -d install ?
Yes, -d is short for --download-only, but if I say "-d" then they'll say "what does -d stand for?"
I did man it, but the output was unclear saying it needs.  the output still says it needs etc amount of space after installation, so I wanted to make sure
I feel like a bug on the windshield of life. I cant figure out a problem getting ubuntu to connect to the internet. Windows can (dual boot XP) and Ubuntu can when directly connected to the modem just not through the router. I can bring up the router info at 192.168.0.1 I need another clear mind to look at this
static ip ?
yes

hey all. how can i make gnome-keyring-daemon automatically unlock my ssh key at login?
I don't recall having to unlock keyring to use ssh keys before. as I recall that's why I setup ssh keys no no passwords were needed
"why I setup ssh keys no no passwords were needed" <- i don't understand. you mean you create passwordless ssh keys?
I setup ssh keys SO no passwords were needed
but you probably still have a password given to the key
oh no I created the ssh keys without a text password that why none needed.  http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html
i'd prefer to have keys protected by password.. but the same time i'd like to have them already unlocked when i'm logged in
your account is already protected with password. if you want 2 or 10 levels of passwords that's up to you and here you are now asking not to have them
i know how to create passwordless keys.. but that is not the point.  i'm asking something that seems widely supported, according to google searches... it just doesn't work for me
not me I use windows. vista rocks
vista has turned a bit sluggish on a hp I have
uhhh just defrag the hd

upgrade to linux :P
7 seems better, but now they are forcing 8 on us
noooooooooooo
I would, but I have trouble making any buntu boot from cd on hps.  7 runs lighter at least, on systems a couple of years ol. 7 runs lighter than Ubuntu even
you should check out ubuntu 10.04 minimal.  it only install the base os and then you selectively install whatever you want from the command line, that's all I use
after I found lubuntu I have been pretty happy with it on most computers, but still have trouble booting the cd on HP pavilions
it won't boot at all?
trouble is the cd will not boot up to the regular menu, and ends up in a black screen message. I cannot get past it some how
I've had that happen to me before, it might work if you try a different version of ubuntu and then upgrade

is "run nautilus" a command 
no, just nautilus
nothing happen it just get stuck in next line
strange. How did it start? I mean, are you working on a fresh install, or has it been working some time ago?
i think some services relating to nautils got stop...  i install the OS 2 hours ago
2 hours, Was it working at first?
every thing was working fine before.  i just installed the java and loged out. for next login it seems to be in bad shape ..
and after logging in again it's all broken?
xactly.  very strange that i could access Application menu, system menu but not the places menu..

i guess no actually i just re-logined not re booted

anyone knows if and whether it's possible to enable 2FA when authenticating LOCALLY in an ubuntu host?. that is from the login screen
i'm not sure i follow -- 2fa involves some remote source generally. Do you mean you want to do this without talking to google at all?. *google, .e.g
what i have in mind  is that when i boot up my pc and i see the login screen, to see username/password/token. i dont mind "talking" to google..  does that make sense?
https://askubuntu.com/questions/609117/how-to-setup-two-factor-authentication-in-ubuntu-for-ubuntu-users-using-google-a ?.  afaict, pam supports it, you just have to configure it all.  i guess i'm not sure if the login screen supports it, which is your point.  oh it mentions it in step 3 :)
cool - thanks  i will take a look at step 3 (yes that's the part i am interested in).
good luck; it certainly seems possible
i didn't work. thank god I had webmin enabled and i managed to edit the /etc/pam.d/auth.common file. otherwise i couldn't login with either root or normal user account.
hrm, i thought that guide said to only enable it for a test user, for specifically that reason
i did enable it for my normal user. but i think it broke the whole authentication process
right, i would not have done that :)
pre-pending "auth required pam_google_authenticator.so"
make a new user and punish them :).  right, you have to manually remove that to disable it, aiui.  (that's in that AU article)
anyways... probably gonna play with a Rpi to make sure i understand how it properly works.. thanks for your time 
yeah, that seems like a good testbed :).  i don't know much about it, sorry i couldnt' give more details
it's ok.

i had a graphical tool for mounting devices. anyone else use it? i dont remember the name
gmount-iso
it started with system
i'm starting to think there's a hardware problem? the system doesn't seem to want to boot from the external USB CD-ROM drive and the internal drive has failed
that could be an issue with the boot order in the bios
i have no devices attached except the USB CD-ROM drive
some bios configs don't allow for booting from external devices
the BIOS lists numerous external USB boot options
50 mbyte/sec writes across the network to a samba share. That'll do :D
how do you do that?.  increase the networkspeed that is
gbit network plus increase the send / receive buffers for samba from 8192 to 40960
how do you adapt the buffers?
socket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY SO_KEEPALIVE SO_RCVBUF=40960 SO_. SNDBUF=40960 <- put that in /etc/samba/smb.conf
under general options?.  and where to put the socket options part
yes, that's under general options

session crashing on startup?
Its just weird. He tries to run the live cd. But it goes onto the desktop and 3 seconds later screen goes blank and goes back to the log in screen. We have tried diff iso programs and different cd's and 32-bit / 64-bit. Stil does it
so, gentlemen - I've been updating from 13.10 to 14.04.1, a dpkg error message popped up and now my /usr/bin/ is empty - any idea how to salvage this?

: i suggest you boot your system from a live disk and copy all the binaries. and then do debsums and apt-get --reinstall install until everything looks good. oh, between copying and fixing, you should change-root over to your installation, of course

Is there a way I can change eth2 to eth1 without rebooting the system? I changed the 70-persistent-net.rules file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ to remove a eth1 that was installed via a usb device.

restarting udev didn't help. I also restarted the network which didn't help either

I get the same error: .: 14: Can't open /etc/init.d/functions

Is there some simple way to have 7.10 run "avast" in terminal ever so often?
yes. it's called "cron".
Ok, sweet, I'll check that out, thanks.  how easy is it to use?

Ah, poo. Is there a way to make a shortcut/link that just opens terminal and runs "avast"?

you need to setup the xorg.conf file.  really? mine doesn't
are you using toshiba?
dell
i booted up and my 21" popped up etc... but its not using it's own config.. its using generic or my laptop's config because i dont know how to set the external monitor's config to "external monitor".  its using my laptop's resolution of 1200x780
you need to setup xorg.conf for that. Does your hotkey work to switch when you're already in X?
im using dell inspiron 8500.  i cant switch out of it when im in X.  i guess it sees that i have an external and it uses it.. but how would i add resolution config to it ... i have a long line of config prepared for the big external. err ! hehe. *: i guess it sees that i have an external and it uses it.. but how would i add resolution config to it ... i have a long line of config prepared for the big external.  do you use twinmode?
yeah.  you need to setup two device profiles and two monitor profiles in xorg.conf. there is good documentation in the nvidia drivers
i did that already.. but how would i link them to the xorglayout etc?. the hotkey would guy which is which?
hey guys need help with cron tab. i want to execute a shell script every hour. so i gave crontab -e. and add teh entry accordingly but i dont know how to save the file and exit the editor. because usually i give ecp + wq

nano?
no standard editor

no its not a standard editor. crontab opens on its own some shitty editor
put your hosts on a single ip line. It will resolve the first one it hits. 127.0.0.1 localhost smartmirror.com mywebsite.com foo.com
127.0.0.1 localhost smartmirror.com is what I've in hosts file. curl localhost:5000/ returns 404 but curl smartmirror.com:5000/ works fine
then you need to fix your vhosts to listen on that address. *:5000 should do it. for all addresses
My ISP set my reverse dns to my domain name. I'm also running two nameservers of that domain on the same ip. How do I have to edit my resolve.conf for the reverse dns to work ?
lucky you :\. Mine gives only dynamic ip addresses and hence no reverse domains
what you mean? I don't know how to make it work
you said you've contacted your isp already?
yes, they have set it up, altho host ipaddress doesn't resolve
well, that's just a matter of time to make it work :P I can't get one no matter what I try.
they mentioned to check my resolve.conf

when I dual booted I played with Songbird. It seems to have good community support and features. I got the children off itunes and onto Songbird and they like.
k thanks
do you also use windows?
ya i have dual boot, but i dont get on windows that much
If you check out Songbird, beware that you can't share the music library with both systems, you will need to maintain two libraries (one of the reasons I left).
ya i did play with that and songbird doesn't work with anything else. Do you know anything about amarok?
ubuntu seems to ignore /etc/apt/apt.conf. and a default one is not provided
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/70debconf. apt.conf is split into small files into /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
i tried appending APT::Default-Release "version"; but it seems to ignore it. i replaced version with warty
in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/70debconf ?
yeah.  it still pulls down hoary packages when i try to upgrade
are you running warty?
yup
then you should not add APT::Default-Release "version"
how else can I then select packages from hoary but default to warty?
google for apt-pinning
why wouldn't this work? it's exactly what i want
http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.html for example.  i don't know... but apt-pinning is the right way to do this
i tried that too.  didn't work either
what packages do you need? can't you use backports instead?
i want to just pull down xorg
is there a way to commandline format a usb drive?
yes
for some reason my ubuntu has it as read-only and won't let me fix it >_<.  what's the command?
you can format it from gparted
it won't do it. i click it, it says its formatting, and it's still read-only. or is gparted and disk utility diff?
gparted and disk utility is different
okay, i'll look for gparted then

Well I am having an internet connection that is being provided by an ADSL router .. but I don't have those stuff at my place .. well I am being provided with private set of values for ip address ,subnet mask, gateway and so on .. but I am founding an special entry as broadcast address :: that was not being provided by my service provider .. so can any body can help me on this w. hat is this broadcast address with .. any help would be of great help ...

can somebody help me to setup tv out with nvidia card?
try this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=23628&highlight=nvidia+tv-out
Trigg: tried :(. amd64 has no nvtv
running your own irc server can be a great exercise, but there are plenty of networks available to most likely handle your needs, including of course, freenode
yes, you're right. I think it would be still geek cool to say you run your own irc server though. That what I'm mainly after.
ask yourself, what am I gaining by jumping to 3.5? if you can't answer that, don't.
hi. how to config ati in ubuntu 7.04. help

Is ubuntu support codec to view .avi?
yes
how to install the codec?
If I have chrooted to a mounted filesystem image, can anyone tell me what I need to do in order to run X applications within the chroot? I've copied over .X11-unix and .ICE-unix but still get connection refused to the X server (running outside the chroot).
.Xauthority.  also, mount -o bind instead of copying .X11-unix might work better
I tried copying .Xauthority (from my home directory, no?), but this didn't seem to have any effect. Are you suggesting to mount my real /tmp over the chrooted /tmp with -o bind?
Dr-willis i mean, im downloading all the debs into my desktop folder, my terminal starts with my home directory, and i must always change the directory so i want to change the first prompt of my terminal because i do not want to change the directory always
thats totally NOt what you have been asking then.. thats NOT changeing the prompt.  thats changeing the initial working directory...  You could just make a link from the dir you want to some location in your /home/username/whatever to save typeing.. i guess..  or make an alias taht does the cd command for you,.
excuse me, im really sorry
having to 'cd Desktop' is rather trivial ..' cd D<tab> enter '
when i open the terminal. there i can change that i want to start terminal with a specific command. but cd /media/Zeugz/Basic/ is not the right command. which command is it then ?
cd /media/whatever is the proper command to change the directory.. You do realize that linux is Case senestive. what happens when you use that command?
case sensitive is that i do have to consider that Zeugz is not zeugz
Case Senesitivity is a big deal. :) ZOO is not the same as Zoo is not the same as zoo
first nothing, when i close and open terminal there is an error ( in german it is "Beim Erzeugen des Kindprozesses fur dieses Terminal ist ein Fehler aufgetreten"
how can i make x start automatically with the grapichal logon screem?
should be default
my logon screen does not appear after i shutdown x
sudo modprobe -r psmouse has no feedback, so I don't know if it's done what it's meant to do
easy, "lsmod | grep -i mouse"
invokes nothing
hi there. i'm trying to setup an SMTP server so that i can send mail from a django application. i'm obviously not doing something correct because i get a [Errno 111] Connection refused. can someone help me identify what is going wrong
try connecting manually to confirm whether it's an SMTP issue or a django issue
how can i do that
telnet {ip} {port}
thank you. no luck. tryin <ip> ..... and no movement. should i be doing that locally. as in on the server
sounds like either firewall or bad smtp config
ohhh yep likely my ufw settings. forgot i installed that...
uncomplicated firewall is uncomplicated :)
haha yep. which ports should be open 
depends what protocol you're using - 25 for SMTP, 587 for TLS, and another one that escapes me...
i think 587 is smtp. no?
465 was the other one http://serverfault.com/questions/149903/what-ports-to-open-for-mail-server
so if i want to just send mail. not receive. what would be the best choice
25 for smtp, 487 if you want secure login
487?
hello guys, just a quickie, I want to compile a wireless driver to my laptop. My question is, if I someday update the kernel, will I have to recompile it? here is a link if you want more info... http://tinyurl.com/help1004

Broadcom bcm4312 rev 01)
so can someone help me with recording sound?
try arecord -vv /dev/null in a terminal. if you aren't getting input, like me the input level will be zero or very low, like 1% or so.
I get 00%
Yup. we are unlucky.
so there's no way to troubleshoot this?
Any help, I just installed new Ubuntu. My computer chatters when processor is doing work. No problem with Lubuntu. or Crunchbang
is the storage drive old?
hmm 3 years max
hmm, should be ok. How much RAM do you have?
2gb
that's plent. I thought you'd say 256Mb which would make your system use swap more and explain the noise
This problem came with LTS version, no problem with 11.04 (Natty) version. Weird?. and that noise comes from speakers
so where is the problem if it's not in 11.04?
10.42.2 LTS version
then why not just use Natty....  maybe the newer kernel makes things nicer for your hardwre
No idea, I use that then. What difference betheen natty and lts version. natty works with me? 1.6ghz, 2gb ram and no idea about video card
how can i enable HTML rendering?
in what /. ?
ubuntu.  ubuntu
ubuntu is an OS - not an application, please define html rendering in ubuntu

Hey, is anyone here familiar with using an Xbox 360 wired controller with Hardy?
not likely =\
Not likely it'll work?
Not likely someone here has done it. oh
Which worked the first time, but after I unplugged it once I plugged it in again it stopped working.
I may be wrong....  how many times did you reboot =P
So far once.
hehheh
I tried to redo the guide a few times but it didn't get me anywhere.. Here's something more general then.
any VLC expert here? I need help transcode some streaming online video.
I'm hardly an expert but have fiddled with transcoding a number of things ... I assume you have gone through the transcoding docs ?.  although I'm ashamed to say the only transcoding I have done is on Windoze
No i'm trying to transcode a video, connecting to my http://localhost:port - and then trying to record that streaming live video okay. when I click transcode and choosed mpeg2. and then raw. I click filename then finish, it starts recording but here it doesn't preview the picture, so I can't WATCH while recording, thats one issue, and #2 issue is that the record doesn't have sound.
I have found similar issues when transcoding, particularlywhen dealing with basic mpeg2...I found I had to try various audio transcodings as sometime video would be fine but no sound, or certain combinations then could not be played by other devices
what do I do then... is it possible to record via Mplayer? or anything else, cause VLC is not doing a great job
are you using the GUI or the command line ?
i'm in X. i just opened VLC. then trying to transcode by going to file > wizard, so yeah its a gui
I can show you some of the full transcode commands I use if that helps
I'd like to transcode the live stream + watching it in the same time, does your command do that?
no but since you are getting some joy i.e. video but no sound then it may give you some ideas
okay
is there a seperate channel for ppc support ?. cuz noone seems to have a clue of the prob....?
thanks that's what I was thinking/hoping now I get to sleep easy tonight knowing tomorrow I get to rescue a friend from windows, LOL Perhaps I can install 8.10 and she'll be happy using it, we will see.
just go easy and run it for the first backup steps of live boot no install, to ensure that all your files are available...
oh of course. I'll make sure all data is properly backed up before jumping to far. At this point data recovery and back up is the main priority. Converting another windows system will just be icing on the cake if possible.
yeah, i convinced about 10 ppl to give it a shot so far with 8.04 still and i m updating all the systems as i visit my firends :)
!yay
thanks bodsda
no probs

Help: I get a xdpyingo: unable to display ":0" error when I ssh into my ubuntu machine. any ideas?
are you connecting with the -X option?
I tried both I get the same thing
does the system you connect to have an x server running?
not sure
because that's what xdpyingo is for, to get details of the x server: http://linux.die.net/man/1/xdpyinfo.  so if no x server is running, it wouldexplain why
ok. how would i restart it
you'd need to run: startx but if you are connected via SSH it will display on the client afaik
oh.  what would you suggest
did you install ubuntu server by any chance?
no
what is the output of: lsb_release -sc on the server side?
lucid
and what desktop environment are you using?. manolitos: ask and see
gnome
if you run: apt-cache policy ubuntu-desktop is it installed?
yea.  what are you thinking?
for some reason the x server hasn't started but enough boot has completed to complete the network setup and start the SSH server
yea but I can do X11 forwarding

k :)
how do i go about diagnosing a consistant lockup? if i boot into the recovery mode kernel (2.6.20) the system is stable. if i boot into the regular kernel, it locks after i get to the gdm. it seemd to be time related. if i am fast enough, i can log in, but it locks before the gnome splash apears. it is a hard lock...no ctrl-alt-number terminals, no capslock leds, no hard drive activity. just a hard reset is all i can do. it seem. s to take 30 seconds to lock from the time the gdm is up.
I'd suspect a X driver issue.
even though the gdm fully shows, even the animated icon?
quite possibly, yes.  what card do you have, what driver are you using?
nvidia 6150, and the driver in the repo..  what is the command to change vid drivers. i should be able to change to a vesa driver and be stable if it is the driver, right?
Well let us see what happens now. It gives sdc errors at bootup as well. dmesg is full of em. But it reads the card. I will just disconnect it from the bus if its simply connected via a usb header.  You still around?
yeah, ish
Haha okay
i doubt libdri2.so doesnt has anything to do with xorg. so I'm still interested in finding dri symbols in my Xserver, where do i get it. its not that file
libdri2 does have to do with xorg
not that the package named `libdri2'
!info libdri2
above: <ubottu#ubuntu[20:19]> File libdri2.so found in libdri2-1, libdri2-dev. anyway that is not my question. or maybe it is, i'm not sure
is hal related to xserver?
well hal is related to hardware detection and other things i believe, so if your video card or anything isn't being detected or used properly, that could cause x to fail
I have removed hal in Xserver not command mode! that's Y it caused sine problems, but now using recovery mode doesn't work
hi all......has anyone ever experienced sluggish rdesktop / terminal server client performance?. its very sluggish on doing screen refresh
that's pretty much dependent of your network connection.  you could try lowering the graphics
mm... not really... using the same machine, same network.......... but windows xp, i can connect to the other end, and performance is very smooth
ashley_, for the complete command ;) apt-cache search flash | pastebinit.  you're using tsclient?
i've tried to lower the graphics..... even scale down the colour to 256... but still slow.  yeah.. and i've tried rdesktop too
do you experience this behaviour with all the machines you try to connect to?
yup
what's it's loadavg?
mm... not sure if that has any effect... but my load is 0.87, 0.53, 0.32
do you have ways to generating debug information?
mmmm nope... i dont know how to do that with tsclient
without debugging info is kind of hard to tell anything coherent
another funny thing is........... since rdesktop is slow.... i tried to use vnc....... i installed tightvnc on that remote machine............. and tried to connect to it........ it prompts for password, but immediately disconnect after that
really? what kind of fw are you using on your host and in your remote machine?
fw?. firewall?. no firewall

can someone help me out with a dns/resolv.conf problem I'm having on my linode ubuntu machine? It's crazy because I can ssh into the box, but once I'm in, I can't ping anything... or resolve anything. I've confirmed with linode.com the resolv.conf nameserver ip is correct. for the atlanta region
can you ping an IP rather than a domain name?
nope. can't even ping localhost or 127.0.0.1. it's crazy. so when i do apt-get update it says ubuntu.com... can't resolve. but ssh works fine... apache works fine etc. maybe it's a resolv.conf problem???
it sounds more like a network problem, like your route or gateway is wrong maybe
doh... not resolv.conf... meant iptables
hello. I search a live cd iso of ubuntu. Do you know where i can find one ?
there's a test one, but it's not yet been widely released
ok. thnak you. There is bad link for it in the wiki
I'm having network issues can someone assist?. ok I'm using Ubuntu Server 12.04.3 and whenever I reboot I lose my internet connection.. resolv.conf keeps getting reset.... it did not do this in 12.04.2 (I still have that server going for comparison). any ideas
is it only nameserver or full connecttion -- can you ping 8.8.8.8 for example. (when the network is down after reboot). and how do you fix that then? I mean, if you loose the net in every reboot you must do something to get it back?
well when I reboot I have to go back in to resolv.conf and manually add a nameserver...then it works...at least until I reboot
so only thing broken is resolv.conf ? Thats generated automatically so its no suprise changes made there are lost. You need to fix your configuration.
yeah I know but wher do I make the configuration change
if you get the connection from dhcp, then i suggest fixing that
I'm reading as I'm typing on google. it's a static ip
I'm running Karmic, and something strange just happened. I was using firefox and all of a sudden the screen went all funny. It broke up into rectangular segments and those frozen segments rendered random parts of the screen. Is that just a freak video driver crash?

how?
How do I stop wget? I see a few entries from Google which all recommend CTRL+C, but this doesn't suffice. I specified the -k option (convert links) which doesn't happen if I interrupt with ^c. I had to specify a rather deep recursion length, but I don't want to wait for it to stop. Eventually, I want to kill it, *but* I want it to convert the links when done.
using top, then kill the process.  maybe?
That's even worse :)
Is there a way to supply the sudo command with the password to avoid prompts in a shell script?
just run it as root
like sudo su script.sh?
no, like su; ./script.sh
Brilliant, thank you :)
though, if you don't know those kind of things, I'm not sure you should be writing shell scripts that run as root. or need any root access
I'm making a install script to install my favourite applications from a fresh install in ubuntu :). so its just sudo apt-get install ssh etc
hi there! could you help me please with my screen&resolution problem?

My folder icons in nautilus look like empty file icons instead of folder icons (14.04)
did you upgrade Ubuntu to 14.04?
no it was a clean install. to ubuntu 14.04, and the folders were working initially
very strange
yep :P
Is this problem in every folder'. ?
yes all folders look like empty files
How work with the Guest account?
okay the problem was i was using the Icons theme: Tango instead of Ubuntu-mono-dark
!info mono. the windows version it says, though, so go google
hey there. By the way, are you setting up a new bot? Metabot?

Hi all.. Whenever I try to install something. I get error to do `apt-get install -f`
show the full output in http://paste.ubuntu.com - obviously you have prior package issues
and whenever I do that it will go and installl something will failure at end.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/14489753/ it's 12.04
and you're trying to set up apache today is it?
no php 5.6
but your paste shows it's trying to install the apache module for php5, which is having issues because it can't install apache main...
aha so I should I fix this first?
yep
but how :P
Someone I know also have ubuntu running fine on a MACBook, but I got no idea how to fix the problem
hi.. how do I recover grub? I tried to install gentoo and it just overwritten my ubuntu grub and now it gives "error 15"
You can boot from live CD and restore the grub from the terminal
but how?
You have type in the terminal: grub.  one moment... I'll check for the right commands.  you need to type: sudo grub. then you type: root (hd0,0). when your ubuntu root partion is sda1 or hda1. if it is hda2 or sda2 you type: root (hd0,1). next step is typing: setup (hd0). now close grub by typing: quit
why am I getting this? W: Failed to fetch http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/xenial/InRelease Temporary failure resolving 'archive.canonical.com'. (during apt-get update_. )*
are you able to resolve it?
curl works on the link
on the system in question?
yus
in what context are you seeing this?
one of the few final messages during `sudo apt-get update --fix-missing`
does it happen every time?
yeah, but to be fair, I get an error on a docker link first.  I just figured that that shouldn't impact cannonical stuff
sounds like possibly buggy network.  is this in a docker container?
no
s/buggy/slow/.  dunno
this last time, it didn't produce any crap for cannonical. although it seems to be rather regular.  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ac4c473de825d01916fbf18a88c207bd. after the fetch on line 6, it just zips right through with those warnings
seems like DNS issues
but shouldn't it like... time out or something? instead of zip right through the last lines?
I don't konw what you mean by zip. Apt will try to download all index files and then emits any warningns or errors at the end..  and a DNS failure on your client is typically pretty fast
right, by zip I mean the messages come really fast
the relative speed of error messages is ... not really anything
can I attempt a manual fetch on a specific link?
Does anyone have a solution for my problem with the drivers
depends on what kind of hardware the drivers are for
graphics card. nvidea drivers
ok since i have yet to find anyone with similar problems as mine (1 hr+ searching) When i insert the 8.10 cd, and boot into install/live it loads and then just has a blinking cursor on screen for over 20 minutes
you have a newer motherboard?
no its a dell p4 motherboard so relatively old
you might need to try the "alternate" cd for install.
that is the only thing i could think but the weird thing is that 8.04 live cd boots fine ... hmm
so I'm trying to install a package and I think I'm getting dependency conflicts
what's the error?
"The following packages have unmet dependencies.". a list of packages
so :) go met them :). meet*
then E:Unable to correct you may have held broken packages. I'm in a CLI only interface at the moment trying to install enlightenment from a ppa, I'm wondering what can cause something like that
sudo apt-get install -f
right, at the moment I ran through all of the commands to clean up, but none of the packages mentioned were installed
what are you trying to install?
enligthenment DE. the ppa for 20, I should also mention I just did a base-install
did you follow http://ubuntuportal.com/2015/02/how-to-install-enlightenment-e20-desktop-environment-in-ubuntu-14-04-14-10.html ?
yes, and I got that error, so I removed the ppa and cleaned up
what did install -f tell you?
ah crap. what does CTRL A do in the CLI. never tried to type it before, just did it out of habbit. now I can't move the cursor haha
just hit enter. and retype
kk, now. i'll readd the ppa
then do sudo apt-get update.  then do the install
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming.. The following packages have unmet dependencies:
So, re-reading the UEFI documentation, it tells me to "disable fastboot" and "Intel Smart Response Technology". My bios doesn't have either of those.
yeah that's more of an *if* thing; nomodeset changed nothing i take it?
Daftykins, I can't get to nomodeset
how come?
when I press F6, there was an error message on the Acer loading screen. it was on for half a sec, said something like "Can't find ??//?/ fsck" or something
hmm, my instinct would be to remake the flash drive as it could be a bit iffy.
Daftykins: Which program should I use to create the flashdrive?
which OS?
64 bit Ubuntu 12.04
which OS do you use to create it from, i mean?
I have access to Ubuntu 12.04 and Win 7.
universal USB installer from pendrivelinux.com should be good for Windows
and for ubuntu?
just the command line utility 'dd' used appropriately would work
Oh jeesh. I've had experience with DD. My dd-fu is lacking..  even for a UEFI scheme?
how do I get my gdesklets to load at startup?
add them to System > Preferences > Session > Startup.  s/them/it... make an entry for gdesklets
just gdesklets. ?
yes
ok, thanks
another small question: can anyone recommend a good dc++ client?

Hello, I'm compiling some source code and I think it wants gtk+ 2.0. can I fix this? output of ./configure: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1515712/. all of gtk2 in the repository seems to be examples or "engines"
have you installed the dev libraries of gtk2? not just the binaries.
I can't seem to find and dev files :(. err packages
usually it'll be the same as the packages with -dev added to the end of the package name.
I am using tab completion after gtk2 with nothing with a -dev
Often (every time?) when I start my computer (using Ubuntu), the window manager doesn't show up and I'm put onto tty1 by default.. This I don't mind, except that "service lightdm status" returns that it's running (and its PID).. I CTRL+ALT+F7 and it's a black screen.. so I sudo service lightdm restart and it works fine. Does anyone know what's going on?
sounds like it isn't starting
Sorry, my posts are pretty spaced out with all the traffic in here. I said that "service lightdm status" says that it is started and has a PID.. s/started/running
what about pgrep?
You want me to see if the process is running using pgrep?
yup
brb..  Okay, the problem is manifest right now.
yeah?
pgrep lightdm = 1238
ew
service lightdm status returns the same PID.
maybe it's starting earlier than its deps
This seems reasonable..  Although, surely there's a mechanism to prevent that from happening?
upstart, theoretically :p
you know...it may have to do with my monitor situation...
check out /var/log/lightdm
I often change the amount and which monitors I'm using...
mm, wouldn't be my first guess
I'm using a laptop. It seems that the problem only manifests itself when I'm docked (so the laptop monitor is not being used, and two external monitors are being used)..  Nothing interesting in lightdm.log but there are five others ^_^
ohhhh. like maybe it's trying to show the login screen on one that doesn't exist
perhaps.
I could believe that
how cute, "write 35 bytes to daemon" "Read 8 bytes from daemon" come on!
that sounds super useful

So, when I open my "Downloads" folder created in the default Lubuntu 15.10 install, something called "wrestool" takes up all my memory, then everything freezes. Any ideas?
open a terminal go to ~/Downloads then do a "ls -al" whats in there?
will do. I have a feeling this is also related to somethnig that is happening to a few games that used to run perfectly fine..  all that is there. http://i.imgur.com/Ldkfi6U.png
did you do something with themes, icons or wrestool/icoutils?
nope..  and this only happens in my Downloads folder. Everything else appears to work fine.

yep

hi all. anyone can help me about java plugin on firefox3beta5?
what's the issue?
i use gutsy 7.10 and i installed firefox3b5. but i cant open any java pages. or applications :S
I was using at home (I'm at work now) the b43 driver for my BCM94311 chipset and WPA encryption and got it to only connect at a max. of maybe 5Mbps instead of a full 54. Does anyone have any ideas.
is it faster with ndiswrapper or in windows?
No clue on ndis with Hardy but in Gutsy I had it set up before. And also in Vista it works fine. It's a software problem with b43.

what is the log file I can check when I try to open a file to a Samba share?
samba logs in /var/log/samba
I have a lot of files there and looking at the file log.MY-MACHINE I don't see anything
look at the ip address also and the overall samba log and syslog
from a PC I can open and modify all documents of the share but I cannot from another
thats user or network share permissions then
but I don't have put any samba user, nor for the PC that works fine
the username you are connecting to the samba machine as must be "authorized" to use the share you want
I use the force user and force group options in the samba share.  and it works for a new pc

Executing it is not the problem. The command works, but it doesnt work when I try to make it run on boot with that command.
Ah, didn't see that part

hello all. how do I stop cron logging from going to auth.log ? limit it to only go to cron.log or /var/log/syslog file only. I enabled cron.* line in /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default, restarted rsyslog, but its still sending cron log to /var/log/auth.log. guys ?
is it cron log, or cron authentication log?
looks to me like regular cron log
the "cron login as root" should get logged in auth.log, wouldn't it?
nope ?
Dec 17 12:17:01 alkis CRON[29959]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0). This line needs to be in auth.log, as cron "logged in" to run things. But the output of cron of course isn't there
this line repeats every min or for every run of cron. mostly its in-consequential. its just filling up log
It's not a log of cron, but a log of pam
I needed to check ssh auth log
You're looking at the wrong place to disable it

but a crt has builtin theft prevention. yes. 19" lcds?. er wait. 19'?. how much would an lcd that gives me 1600x1200 cost?
samsung 213T can be found for ~ $900 USD
heh
its pretty good and does 1600x1200
hrm
if i had a job i would have already bought one
id like to go past 1600x1200 too.. sigh. every time i get a bigger monitor, i get used to the higher resolution and then want more
above 1600x1200 is expensive
blah
see apple 30" lcd for example ;)
yeah. screw that
or the 1920x1200 lcds for ~ $2000
1920x1200 could be okay. i could see 2 facing pages on a pdf
but you could buy two 1600x1200 lcds for cheaper than one 1920x1200
but then you have 2 lcds
and a lot more screen space :). two 1600x1200 is roughly 65% bigger than a more expensive single 1920x1200
i want 2024x1536. :)
why not just a 9MP display ;)
where can i get one?
ibm and viewsonic make them, probably other companies too
er i meant 2048x1536. thats 3MP. crap
IBM T221
my 19" crt will have to do for a couple more years :(
only around $8000
hrm. lemme check my wallet. hrm. all i have are receipts showing that i USED to have money
plus it requires a special video card since no desktop cards can drive anything near that big
same with the large apple display
yep, but the apple display is only about half the ibm resolution, heh ;). and ibm's is only ~ 20"
9MP in 20"?!
*sigh* I just don't get apt-cacher-ng. :(
how are you configuring it on the client?
Well, I'm not exactly sure how it's supposed to be configured. I'm starting with a chef recipe. He deposits a file in /etc/apt.conf.d that sets a proxy. That works fine, except it then doesn't proxy the stuff in sources.list. Only stuff in /etc/apt/sources.list.d.  Ideally the client wouldn't have any repo's configured, and would point to the proxy for everything, right?
sources.list should stay the same. all you'd need to do is add Acquire::http { Proxy "http://ip.of.apt.acacher:port"; };.  is that roughly what chef added?
Well, I did an apt-get update, and it was grabbing stuff from ubuntu, not from the proxy....  yes, I think that's what it added.
yes, it still grapbs stuff from ubuntu repo ... via the proxy
eventhough it's logging the address of ubuntu?.  I'll have to tcpdump that...
reverted to original sources.list, "Couldn't stat source package list http://us.archive.ubuntu.com hoary/main Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists"
i meant
i did apt-get update, synaptic now opens fine, but if i reload... it screws up and wo'nt get the gpg files then it's all crap from there. is that normal?
not really
hmm
can you paste your sources.list on some pastebin please. breezy badger
http://pastebin.com/281561
looks normal to me
yeah. i know
does apt-get update give an error?
no. i think it has something to do with the gpg authentication. i don't know how to revert it to the original
try apt-get -s dist-upgrade. -s means simulate, so it doesn't really do anything
ok, now what?
no errors?
none. well.... at first, it told me to apt-get update, so i did. then i redid what you told me to do. then it gave no errors
and what is the exact error synaptic gives you?
now if i hit reload in synaptic, it give me "Could not download all repository indexes" again
only "Could not download.."? no other errors?
i'll pastbin it. http://pastebin.com/281562

if I change the permissions of /media/cdrom0 and put something into the drive it changes back to only root, I need to change it back.. and keep it the way I set it.
Did you change the ownership, like I suggested a while ago?
I did, but when I put a volume in the drive it just changes back.
How are you mounting it?
I had to mount it at one time as root because some of the files on a disc were hidden, now I want to revert it back to my old settings.
does not tell me how you did it - what command?
it automatically mounts it as root r/o. because Im in the fuse group..  sudo chown --from root:root john:john /media/cdrom0 < is what I typed

what have you done so far....?
Googled until my brain popped. I just want to make a usb startup disk of a newer relese to put on my netbook
well if ya bailing out.... you can just enable all backports.... or you can do just the one package and its deps.
Oh, ok. Where do i do that?

Hmmm probably going to need them, but tomorrow I guess. getting very late here and I thought this wouldn't have been such a battle.

I'm using mdadm to set up my raid5 array, i've don the --create, and a cat /proc/mdstat shows its at 1.1% recovery and should be finished with that in 300minutes. Can I still but a FS on it? or should I wait the 5 hours?
do you run the raid5 directly on the disks or did you make partitions first?
I created them as "Linux raid autodetect" beforehand
oh ok, you let the installer do it :) I think the array is usable while it's doing recovery, it'll just be sluggish (plus not redundant yet)
so I can create the fs and fstab entry on it and start copying data?
yes, but remember, if a drive fails right now, your data is gone
I'm migrating data from an old server, so if a drive dies, I've still got it on the old server.

Hi. I'm running the Kubuntu flavour of Breezy, and for some reason the font size in all gtk1 based programs (like xmms) is almost unreadably small. Anyone know where that could be configured?

I'm using xmms only as an example. The real problem is with all gtk1 apps, and I'd like to fix it somehow.. Abandoning gtk1 apps because of a font problem would be quitting :)

do you get slow transfers from ftp?
would you know why I am able to get a full 100mbit over dc++ but only 45mbit over ftp? out of curiosity
your ftp server has a cap on it, it sounds. you need to go into your settings and make sure all download/upload caps are removed. or set them rediculasly high
umm, how can i check, using proftpd and not seen any such cap in the conf file
umm, hold on. sudo apt-get install gproftpd
i think i get the same caps if i transfer files over http (lighttpd server)
then it will be in system>admin>gproftpd
can't do gproftpd as its a server os and no gui
ooh snap. umm. hrm
maybe if you can locate the line in the gproftpd conf file
sure, lemme look it up. lemme just pastebin this conf file
thanks :).  not sure if its a system wide thing as get max 4mb/s over http too (lighttpd server)

my config was built with gproftpd, and I set it to no cap
thanks for this, i'll play around with my config and see what happens
arg. there is a cap. lol. it's 2444 up and 1794 down
When I copy a very large folder form on HDD to another the file sizes on the second HDD are much larger than those on the first HDD.. I am using just cp, should I use rsync instead?. Both HDD's are ext4.. from one HDD*
Is if the actual file sizes, or the blocks used? I can image a larger block size on the destination device causing that impression. Give us an example of the file sizes on source and destination
So for an entire folder the size is 47GB on one HDD and 96GB on the other..  ^
Hi there! I'm trying to make my wireless card work, but I'm having problems...
whats the kind of card
It's an INPROCOMM IPN2220
I wanna be able to change the start menu icon, the default orange one. Iv done what everyone has currently said and go to the /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/ and replace the distributor-logo.png with the image I want and then refresh the panel. I did that. Then I was told to go where the themes are and go into the current theme Im currently use and find it in there. Iv tried everything but it won't let me change the start menu icon. and I really want to change it to complete my theme
right click on start menu icon and click edit. may work
I'll be able to change the orange icon from there?
not sure, at least eliminate that option
Lol thats funny.  Nope nothing under there
are you sure it can be changed?.  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2841579
Yes, Iv seen many many many screenshots and people have it changed. Like some people have the Mac OS X look going on, so I see the blue apple. Iv seen some people with the Windows Vista Theme(which I'm almost complete with doing) and they have the Windows Vista orb there.  Yup, iv been to that one as well and nothing works

I have ~/bin directory, I want to point ~/bin to a directory in my system , on 'll' command it should look like " bin -> /home/ubuntu/workspace/Scripts"

yes but bin directory should point to /Scripts directory

my USB drive is dead. on lsub can detect it. fdisk -l doesnt. TestDisk doesnt. How can I repair it?
you could try scandisk from grc.  their software is designed for just that problem.  whoops, i meant spinritte.  ***spinrite
<rdw2001..> is that a windows utility?
no, it's usually either a floppy (for old computers) or a very small .iso.  it is the only software out there that can definitively tell you if your HDD is borked.  it *seems* that you have a hardware problem....  have you tried switching USB cases, first?
<rdw2001..> I think my USB, just the one, is gonged. All others are alright though
b/c something that *can* happen is this: there may not be enough USB power to spin the drive... some usb ports put out more power than others.  the inability for linux to see the drive (as a /dev/sd* ) can be something as simple as insufficient power or a bad usb case.  the best way to know for sure is plugging the drive directly to the Motherboard
i think u've a point with the power issue, although all others have been alright this particular one is a problem
anyone having this issue with Terminal Server client in mini notebooks were the screen is cut off at the bottom
when you change resolution -does it fix ?
no.  i am on tsclient 0.150
do i need to turn on the sound server to hear sounds or can all my apps just go to alsa direct?
your apps can use alsa directly, if remember correctly, but if you like sound multiplexing, like 2 sounds at the same time, you have to have esd use alsa
i thought alsa didnt need a multiplexer
i'm using woody and kde. if i get a message on giam while i', listening to a cd, i don't hear the bell in gaim.  but when i turn off the music, all of the gaim sounds come in. delayed.
well im not hearing any sound right now. not giam not rb
sorry but my experience was with kde/arts and not gnome/esd. have you tried the site? it has a link for sound.
thansk 
first things first, you need to have alsa detect ur sound card
alsa detects my sound card i thing. think. it lists my card in the volume control app
make sure that alsa sound server is not muted. i don't know if its on by default in wart but its muted when you compile it
i checked it doesnt seem muted
hmmnn...
you said there was something about sound on their site?
yes..let me look.  heh..sorry but it was 'sounder'. not sound
lol. let me check to make sure the plug didnt pop out of the back of the computer
yep, its stuff like that half of the time :)
apparently thats what happened
cool..enjoy
whoops i guess not. :((
i wonder if anyone has gotten sound up?
sound works when i plugged it into the onboard sound card just not my sb live
maybe there's something about it in the mailing lists..
apparently everything is using oss. and i cant have that

if i have lost my /boot can i take it from another install, another computer, and plop it where it needs to go?
you might be able to reinstall the relevant packages
the whole /boot is gone.
are you booted into the system? do you know how /boot disappeared?
i am. yes. it died when sudo rm -rf /boot was typed in....
i see, well don't reboot
actually, i'm dumb. sorry, that command was done. if i list my / i do not see /boot right beside /bin (if you know what i mean). can i steal /boot of my live usbkey?. *off my usb key

anyone know if "Storm Worm"/ecard email worm only affects Windows ?
If there was a linux virus outbreak, we'd know. So, yes, it only effects Windows.
thanks  - you reckon it's safe to assume it doesn't affect OS X either ? Apparently it works via javascript rather than activex, so that made me a bit wary...
anyone please?. ok so nobody used Proliant Servers ?
what's wrong with it?

I've setup my computer as a bluetooth audio sink so my phone sends audio to it, which will then play though my headphones. When I did this, I noticed it skips, is this a bluetooth bandwith problem, or a problem with pulse audio server?. Is there anyway I could test latency?
I'd recommend MTR, personally.
MTR?
I'm having trouble sending a file from my phone to my pc via bt, phone says "sending failed" I noticed that this seems common. Should I downgrade to an older version of bluez or is there a newer one than 3.26?

yeah.  it used to work before the upgrade to hardy
<> what did u do after that

Anyone know how ubuntu-10.10-netbook-i386.iso can get into the Unity desktop?
after installing, check for latest hardware drivers, if none are available, then your system may not support Unity Desktop
so ubuntu-10.10-netbook-i386.iso is the right thing, though?
what is splash?/
graphical image at boot like windows xp
why would you want that i like the way it is
eyecandy.  there would still be a verbose mode
o ok
hi all. any clues to how to play 3gp files on ubuntu 9.10 gnome.
install 'restricted extras'
they are installed.
ah, ite8212. be sure to use an 80 pin cable, it doesn't like old cables.
it doesn't work at all tho,... there doesn't seem to be a driver for it
yes, the problem is, the driver hasn't been in the kernel for long..
Back to my original question: anyone have experience installing 10.10 on a Gigabyte P55A-UD3?
the board is fairly obscure, which particular component of it are you having issue with.  also check www.ubuntuhcl.org
none yet ... it the board that a local computer shop is using and I'm trying to find out if there are any issues ... I have found no cons searching it on google ....  so, I thought I'd ask here ...
so can someone help me install this kernal source thing?
you don't need kernel source to compile a driver. there's a libdvdcss howto factoid
.. well i've tried following the README but to no avail...
where does it fail?
it says
(don't flood)
"copy the ungzipped file to /usr/src/linux-2.6.x and run "#patch -bf -pl < patch-atmel_reset". this is a requirement i'm pretty sure because it says in order to make the driver work for 2.6 kernels i'd need tod o that
are you positive that the included kernel with Breezy doesn't support your hardware?
so i tried that and then i get this - no file to patch
sed 's/= .*//' is not supposed to delete what comes after = ?
sort of
but it does not ...
hey guys, how to i install a game from a .run?

xine works fine for me
is there some reason why I can't get it to work in firefox (as in launch)
ohh. you want it in browser ?
yeah, like mplayer-plugin
oh.. then i dunno... mozilla-xine works fine for me
is that a plugin?
yes.
I just searched synaptic but it didn't come up
google it - there is a plugin.
xine is installed, and firefox is installed. ahhh
well at least it's not as buggy as fedora is because it tries to be superfast with prelink :)

Bought 50 desktop ubuntu advantage earlier today. Got the email with payment confirmation and that another mail will arrive shortly for the activation. That was 10 hours ago and can't get in contact with anyone at Canonical =( Does anyone have an idea what to do? I need these licenses right away, 50 desktops are currently unusable as it won't register to Landscape
can't you skip this landscape service to make them usable?
kind of. I have some scripts that needs to be run on each desktop so they register to our LDAP/Kerberos environment. Which means, right now my only solution is to run around to 50 desktops and run a bunch of scripts on each =(
it's kind of a bummer to see that on linux. you don't have remote management solution?
yes. Landscape =D
Why are updates noted as not authenticated?
Could be a missing GPG, run apt-get update and see if it corrects it

isn't there any way in karmic to change login window theme?
go to system>admin>login window
that doesn't show how to change the theme
it does. look harder
and its login screen, not login window as it used to be till jaunty
?.  go to local in that and chagne theme
i don't see any "login window" in my karmic's system > admin, i see "login screen" and it doesn't allow me to change theme, it just allows me to enable/disable automatic login and change timeout

so my brilliant friends mother removed ubuntu unity on her toughbook.. i reinstalled it but its still giving me low graphics mode. i wonder if it took out the xorg.conf or something. i cant login at all i get an error before the login screen .... one sec. the system is running in low-graphics mode, your screen graphics card, and input device settings could not be detected.. she removed unity and whatever disappears with it. i reinstalled unity but something is not right still getting the same error
did you reinstall ubuntu-desktop?. that would be the fairly comprehensive way
nope but i might try that ... i have a intel mobile 4 series chipset. would that require special drivers?
I cantchange back to windows
do you get a grub menu?
Huh?. i get this purple screen with 4 things

How do I make ssh server start on bootup?
if you install the ssh service, it should do so.
i had to start it manually...how can i make sure?
packages.ubuntu.com is available now
can I bother you with a related question regarding why my nas mounts sometimes drop off and I have to issue mount -a to get them back ?
That shouldn't happen. Even if the nfs server goes away, it should remain mounted, and a program trying to access that mount should "block"..  Can you tell me more?
not sure what the symptoms and timings are but I have 6 machines on my network and they all exibit the same problem, at some point the mounts from the nas no longer show contents
and when you type "mount" what does it show you?
no errors or anything just empty mounts. when I do 'sudo mount -a' evetyhting visible again.
can you elaborate - what's an "empty mount"?
I have never checked just 'mount' when someone has had the problem so I can't tell you.  when you use nautilus or the like and navigate to e.g. /mnt/archive, then it shows an empty directory
OK, that's your first line of attack. Type it now so you can see what things should look like..  well, that directory has to exist so you can mount the NAS share onto it.  it sounds like some sort of process on the workstation is unmounting those
all 6 machines ?
what happens when you reboot one of those machines? Without doing a "mount -a" is the NAS share mounted?
absolutely
paste me the fstab entry for that mount please
so it is not the case of the directories not existing or anything, all works fine but then after ome yet to be determined event or timeframe, it drops off.  paste here or pastebin ?
paste here
192.168.0.101:/archive/documents /mnt/document-archive nfs defaults 0 0
im wondering if i mistated my question. When you reboot a machine, i want to know if the NAS files are accesible, not just the parent directory
sorry probably has tabs
looks good to me
I have two internal drives, partioned similarly. Last November I instaled/copied my setup over to the 2nd drive. I just restarted my *remote* machine, and it booted on the old drive. Is there a way I can control which drive starts, remotely?
kinda. you can put them both in grub, and modify grub before rebooting
modify grub? in what way?
change the default boot partition..
can I read about modfying grub from the shell?
!version
no, package not distro
you read the factoid to the end ?
having trouble with my /sources.list. I want to add the wine repositories but the docs only explain the old sources format and nothing I do seems to work

thanks, that foo is actually just an example :>.  yes only locally
ok as you all cant help me with my questio which is fine btw, can anyone point me to a reference for a red hat admins guide to ubuntu servers
huh? LOL!.  missed your question
ubuntu bit like windows keep changing stuff lol

basically Im a red hat based server admin and Ive been asked to look at an ubuntu server thats borked but theres a few differences in locations service names stuff like that
hi, i did apt-get upgrade and now i hear no sound through my speakers. the sound config looks good though http://pastebin.com/Fnv7zUcv. any idea how to debug this?
Active Port: analog-output-headphones.  are you listening through headphones jack?
hmm i'm not sure. i'll try some other jacks though.  can you change hte port with pactl too?. ah it's pacmd
your configuration is for alsa not pulse audio right?
i dunno it's the default. i don't use gnome, if that's relevant. i tried pacmd set-sink port for both available ports, but i didn't get sound on either. I did get a click in the headphones as i switched though, so something's plumbed in
the configuration you linked is for Alsa. You can control it with alsa-mixer. Pulseaudio is different software.  which ubuntu/Linux flavour are you using?
yakkety.  i put it in one of the ports at the back and it worked...
oh well eth1 it is
you can rename it with ifrename, if you really have to.... or did i dream that?
no real issue running as eth1..  just curious why
module alias perhaps?
when it was running normally before I re-installed
im turning an 80GB laptop hdd into an external drive for moving files. what should i format it as so it plays nice with Windows and Linux?

what are you formatting with?
used ubuntu's built in stock disk utility. gui. i.e. System > Administration > Disk Utility
Howdo I disable guest login??

hey all, does anyone have extensive experience of Apache 2 under Ubuntu?. in fact, does anyone have Apache 2 running under Ubuntu now? I've got a really odd problem and I'd like to see if it exists on servers other than mine!
if you ask us the actual question we'll be able to tell you
fair nuff. the problem is that if you request a resource such as https://server/example/, apache will quite happily return example.php in its place, assuming the directory doesn't exist. it'll also return example.html if there is no example.php. If I create the example directory, apache returns an empty directory listing as you'd expect
do you have any redirects in .htaccess or your /etc/apache2 config's?
no. I have totally disabled mod_rewrite and it still happens..  it happens on all my Ubuntu servers from what i can tell, its very odd
never had that problem here sorry
do you have apache running anywhere now? it'd really help if someone could confirm its not just me
its a debian server but sure.  you want me to create example.php in /var/www?
that'd be ace, thanks. yeah, create it with an echo line and then try http://server/example/

yes, but I would like to know what nameservers I am using. dhcp

my laser printer CP105b is still no driver. usb interface.... use Virtualbox/ kvm to print. sad.. grub-install success... i saw this line...
did you check the openprinting.og site.  did you also chec the turnoprint site?
no,
did you check the fujixerox site?
but i searched in forum. no find cp105b solve post. fujixerox web, i looked. not driver, only fireware.
I'm in a bit of a jam. I am installing gutsy beta and the install froze up at 88% (importing documents and settings). It appears that it is no longer reading the CD. Normally I would leave this until the morning however the install has already formatted the partition which housed my GRUB and hasn't installed another. any suggestions?
yea go back to 7.04 till 7.10 is stable
7.04 hates the ATI X1000 series and doesn't load X. the text install from the alternate disk stops functioning after it detects hardware
try 6.06
what's even weired is that I previously had gutsy installed earlier this morning, in fact, this is my 2nd install of the day as I managed to blow up X on the first one with fglrx and compiz. *weirder
who has ever successfully installed java on LiveCD??

guys i'm asking a php question here because i get no answer in #php so: i get a pixel color with $pixel = $myimage->getImagePixelColor and then $pixel->getColorValue but how is it possible to set a pixel color in the image, after $pixel->setColorValue theres not method setImagePixelColor, ?
I'm no php expert but I assume there's docs?.  you using this class http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.imagick.php. ?
i told u theres no method to do that!
yeah, so more than likely it's going to be a bit more complicated :) you may have to play w/ the stream, or whatever php's equivalent is

http://paste.ubuntu.com/25591546/ Regarding my freeze problem on 16.04. I will very much appriciate it if someone could take a quick look at a snippet of the syslog. For instance, I get quite few "valid eCryptfs headers not found in file header region [...]", but that's after I've restarted.. !sysre. !sysrq
i dont see anything out of the ordinary in it.  could you upload the entire log? (check the size with ls -lh /var/log/syslog and if it's not too big run "cat /var/log/syslog | nc termbin.com 9999".  also, take a look at ~/.xsession-errors for clues
Thank you. Is it ok I PM you the termbin-link?
you can share it here, there shouldn't be anything delicate in it
All right! http://termbin.com/zqxr
i think that's only the last 20 mins of using the pc.  perhaps /var/log/syslog.1 has info when the pc froze
You're right, sorry. Here's from september 12th (syslog.1). http://termbin.com/04j7. 
nothing stands out, try "zgrep -C10 -Ei "call trace|segmentation" /var/log/syslog.*.gz | nc termbin.com 9999"
http://termbin.com/hs0c . It only appears to happen when i update my system (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade). Could that be an indication of anything?
aha, could you upload the whole log? "zcat /var/log/syslog.2.gz | nc termbin.com 9999"
That command did not return any termbin-link.
Can someone suggest a piece of software that can concatenate video files?
mencoder.  please don't ask me how though: it's a rather complex problem. the documentation for mplayer is among the longest and best, though, so i suggest you check out their docs.
thanks.
anyone know how to debug why a newer package from a custom apt repo doesn't "override" an older package from the ubuntu distribution?
apt-cache policy packagename says what?
it says ubuntu's repos.  the package in question is ceph-deploy, trying to use ceph's repos
version table only shows the ubuntu one?
should that list all alternatives? even if apt deems them "older"?.  yup
different packagename? missing "apt-get update" after adding the repo?
apt-get update done, http://download.ceph.com/debian-infernalis/pool/main/c/ceph-deploy/, thats the package
you added that a a repo to your sources.list?
deb http://download.ceph.com/debian-infernalis/ trusty main.  tried having it in file in sources.list.d and in main sources.list file, no diff.
any error related to that repo while running "apt-get update". ?
Hit http://download.ceph.com trusty InRelease <- from apt-get update.  you know that InRelease stands for? :)
"apt-cache policy" without packagename should list all repos apt will use/check
it's there: 500 http://download.ceph.com/debian-infernalis/ trusty/main i386 Packages. release o=RedHat,a=stable,n=trusty,c=main. origin download.ceph.com
and you're on i386?

i'll try to boot in recovery. otherwise i just see the kubuntu logo during boot
Come on, does it gives a listing of volumes or not?
no. nothing. just a single line with a warning
Recovery won't help because you won't have a root filesystem. Type ls /dev/mapper. See if your luks device is in there
control. just that
Then it's not there. Type cryptsetup open /dev/sda5 (or whatever) sda5_crypt. Your crypttab must be faulty
that's the exact partion :)
I don't need laurels :). Just get going. Btw, version is 16.04?
i dont have cryptsetup in this prompt it seems
No /sbin/cryptsetup?
17.0.1. oh sorry didn't include /sbin. no, with sbin i dont have it either
I myself do not know what has changed with Zesty because they are trying to incorporate systemd into the initramfs. On 16.04 it should normally copy cryptsetup into the initramfs. Your only recourse is now to reboot into the live environment again. And to make sure it gets copied
will do
But I don't know if everything will work out alright now. Because I am ignorant about the new system
i can run teh grub steps again
Grub is fine. Unless you booted the wrong initramfs. But this is a new install right. No other ubuntu there
yes
Reboot to live, cryptsetup open, get back into the chroot.....
sure
And first run lsinitramfs /boot/init* | grep cryptsetup. Also show me the crypttab line
grep cryptsetup does not find anything
back.  here
content for crypttab is `sda5_crypt UUID=628c1039-8a5b-49de-ba89-6a3530e2e7af none luks,discard`. output for `blkid /dev/sda5` is:. `/dev/sda5: UUID="628c1039-8a5b-49de-ba89-6a3530e2e7af" TYPE="crypto_LUKS" PARTUUID="862cf70f-bf4a-4586-86c7-f4476e00aeb2"`
I assume your UUID is correct although discard is not directly required, I assume you have an SSD
i just copypasted from the guide :(
I have a samsung screen from an old desktop pc (last year) and it just doesnt work with ubuntu. I tried it on a mac and on a pc with windows and it works fine but with ubuntu it justrefuses to work! is that normal?
using DVI or VGA conector? You using a KVM switch or anything else weird?
I tried both dvi and vga and it doesnt work
thats very weird.. ive always had 100% success with my various dvi monitors.
the screen isnt even detected so I cant even see what's happening
Hmm.. you dont have 2 monitors attatched do you? or a monitor + tv out?.  what video card anyway?
geforce 7600. I had a geforce 8600 before. It didnt work on both.  and no I only have one screen
Hi all. If I've set a cron.daily job but my computer is powered off and turned on right after the cron.daily's time, the cronjob wouldn't get performed right?
correct, only jobs which are scheduled during operation are executed, at least with cron daemons I know about
Thanks for your answer, so far there's no way to counter this right?
what package do I need to install to get GLIBC >= 2.4?
prolly build-essential will do (assuming you are building stuff)
unrar (from rarlabs.com) needs it... version `GLIBC_2.4' not found (required by unrar)
tried looking in synaptic, it ahs a handy search function ;)
I have. and  this is a server, SSH access only. I installed g++ which got libc6-dev and libc-dev. but it's still erroring

IT works best when you post a description of the problem and not just the link
I did post description earlier: here it is again, I need a hand putting files into the var/www for using lamp also moving the phpMyAdmin folder to same directory, Can anyone help ???
gksudo nautilus is dangerous and unforgiving if you make a mistake, but will give you the permissions needed
does it reset after a while ?
I'm getting an install-info error, "install-info: No dir file specified; try --help for more information." from dpkg when apt tries to update linux-utils
what command are ou using to get that?
I get that error from update manager. I get it from apt-get upgrade. And I also get it after downloading the stupid .deb from the ubuntu repos and doing dpkg -i util-linux
tr sudo apt-get -f install
same thing.
are you using hardy?
yeah
im getting an error. Mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on //filesystem.squashfs failed: input/output error can not mount
when do you get it?
when i put the disk in. it starts to load and bam
what disk and where? more details please
im sorry. i downloaded the ISO from the Ubuntu website. and i burned it to a disk. i used powerISO. as to where... im not sure how to answer that.. i apologize for my incompetence. correct. the laptop currently has no OS
how do i install kubuntu-desktop?
sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop should do the trick.  or do it in synaptic
The following packages have unmet dependencies:. kubuntu-desktop: Depends: konversation but it is not going to be installed. .. it says that when i use apt-get
How do i update my mouse drivers? (sorry for stupid q :P)
they should be updated automatically, but you can run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade.  what drivers are you using? are they 3rd party?
okay. i'm jsut having some weird problem - thought that might fix it. dunno what drivers im using.
what's the problem?
i've been posting it periodically since it gets flooded out.. one sec. Balz, When i scroll a whole bunch with the scroll button on my mouse or the arrow keys, after a while if i let up on the scroller, it will still continue scrolling for a bit. Does this for most apps, but it's particularly bad in firefox&epiphany. Anyone know what this is or where it could be coming from?
that's a hardware insufficiency. your computer is too slow
oh noes!! what do i need to upgrade? ram? video? CPU?
i used to get that A LOT when i was running ubuntu on an old toshiba satellite. It happened a lot with firefox.  it depends on what your hardware specs are. What are you running as far as OS and hardware?
Hardy(8.04 not sure if that matters), 512MB of RAM, Intel onboard chipset(82845G, Brookdale-G), Pentium 4 2.3GHz Processor...
that sounds pretty decent... are you running compiz and compiz effects?.  what you can try is right clicking on the desktop, going to change wallpaper, then selecting the tab with desktop effects and selecting "none"
Not sure. I never specifically enabled anything, but i see it in the process list i think..
by default you may have compiz effects enabled. See my previous message
alright..  that fixed it! thanks very much!
the fact that you have onboard graphics could contribute to the slowdown since compiz uses some more significant graphical power
if i upgrade my RAM from 512 to, say, 2GB, would i be able to enable compiz once again?
Strategy: np. You have plenty of ram for a non-gaming desktop. if you want to run the desktop effects then you should get a graphics card.. Strategy: or you can run xubuntu
Okay.
are you using a desktop or a laptop?
custom-built desktop i built a LOOONG time ago.  lemme think. i was about 10 so.... hmmmmmmmmmmm maybe nearly 3 years ago?
rabidlockergnome: yes,man if you dont install the acelerated options you ll never get it try install envy and from there you ll install correctly your video card
accelerated options?
envy is on the sinaptic repository..yes you must install the accelerated drivers for it.  envy is on the sinaptic repository..yes you must install the accelerated drivers for it

does anybody know how to program gui apps C++ using the GNU compiler? what class do I use? is EZ Windows available?
gtk or qt are the most common libs
to program guis?
Yes. gtk is what Gnome uses; qt is what KDE uses.
alright, i'll try it. thanks
There are of course many others too.
be my guest and rattle them off. lol
does anybody know of any good DVD authoring apps?
I don't think that there are any atm :D
So I guess I need a mac, considering there are not any that allow for full customization in windows
hi, I need to use Intrepid 8.10, but I'm unable to find a repository, is it still available somwhere?

thx, I simply need to install some missing packages, do you sugegst to do it from the CD?
my ethernet port is not working, and the only thing in my /etc/network/interfaces is loopback and eth0 dhcp. eee HA1005 asus netbook. aanyone got any idea why my interfaces config is empty. anyone got any idea on why my ethernet port isnt working/. the lights are on on the hub. but the os won't authenticate on ethernet. and wireless works fine. dead ethernet? anyone?
what does sudo mii-tool say?
marcn: eht0: negotiated 100basetx-fd flow-control, link ok
so the kernel sees the NIC and thinks it is okay. has a link (ie cable is plugged in)
yep. lights on and everything. when i use the network menu to select the ethernet, it tries to sign on and get an address, then stops. marcn: correct
sing on? to what?
sign on. marcn: to get a dhcp lease
ok, there is no authentication going on. DHCP is just a broadcast request
marcn: ok
try: sudo ifup eth0
marcn: done that. marcn: it comes up. marcn: says it gets dhcp
any message?
marcn: then still nothing. marcn: ifup messages are completely normal. says it gets an ip
take a look at /var/log/daemon.log what does the dhclinet say?
marcn: no msgs about eth-. marcn: only about wlan, which is all old. marcn: nothing in the log cept stuff from yesterday
in one window do sudo tail -f /var/log/daemon.log and in another sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
marcn: doing it. marcn: what am i looking for in this tail now?. marcn: says some stuff about avahi not being configured i think
should see lines about dhclinent -- bound to, DHCPACK, DHCPREQUEST.  using network manager?
marcn: a little yeah. marcn: it looks like tail shows it getting dhcp. marcn: and avahi is disabling itself
avahi is some adhoc network naming, not a problem.
marcn: figured. marcn: well it says its getting a dhcp lease. marcn: but nothing goes through
What is your DHCP server? a linksys router or such?
marcn: yes
and that IP is not showing up on eht0?
marcn: but this hasn't worked on any router
what kind ow hw?
asus eee 1005ha. netbook marcn
strange. try turning off the wifi from network manager. by default network manager should switch to the writed connection if it sees both wifi and wired. assumption is it is faster
marcn: nope, just uses wifi. marcn: it's been like this for a while. wireless is fine, wired lights, but won't send any [packets or recieve them. marcn: is there some reason dns wouldn't work for wired but only for wireless/
does it support PXE? maybe try booting and ask for PXE/network boot. if you get an IP you knwo the hw is working.
marcn: good idea
anyone running nforce/self-compiled kernel?
yes and yes
do you use the drivers shipped by nvidia for your mobo?
nope, no need to, they only provide sound anyhow
yes, that's what i was looking for :-).  i thought you could give a me brief explanation how to get that sound chip working.  installer whines about missing nvsound.ko or so
View>>location bar
yea, great tool.. I too have an old 7200rmp laptop hardisk when I got an external enclosure for.

how do i do that?
do you see a menu when you start ubuntu?
yes
you choose the first kernel, the first option, right?
well... i just choose the SO, kernel does everything automatic here
Hi - I am having trouble playing a DVD on mplayer, xine or ogle any help?
http://ubuntuguide.org/#dvdplayback
I read all that - did all that. On Xine it plays sound fine, but the picture is garbled.. On Mplayer - it's all blank - you can forward the image but it won't play. On Ogle - it's even worse than xine - totally garbled video
have you enabled dma?.  you get choppy or no picture?
DMA on my player? I think it's on. Same player and disk worked 100% in Fedora 1. Snowblink: On Xine I get 50% picture - like it's all fuzzy and chooped with rectangles. Snowblink: On mplayer it just won't play - I can forward, but it won't play.
xine-check, hdparm, video drivers - those are the things I'd check
what about my video drivers? I have tried xv and xvshm and GL - they all do the same: nothing!.  I am running nvidia driver fine. all other apps work fine.
is it okay when you look at mpegs or avis?
yes.  Could it be something in my XFree86 config file?
hdparm /dev/<yourdvddrive>
HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Invalid argument. IO_support = 1 (32-bit). unmaskirq = 1 (on). using_dma = 1 (on). keepsettings = 0 (off). readonly = 0 (off). readahead = 256 (on). HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument. (sorry don't know if that was rude!)
yes - you should use pastebin
sorry - ouch.
that looks okay
I'm using x-chat - can't find a "pastebin" anywhere..  This drive worked under Fedora Core - so I thought it would be fine
are you running warty or hoary?
snow: the first one - warty I think
www.pastebin.com
I have installed KDE and am using that. Could that have stuffed something?
Ah. Have you tried under GNOME?
Actually yes. I opened a second X server on ctrl-alt-f8 and tried there. no go
What's the load on your system when you try to watch DVDs?
brb. +1 20%. about 20%. xine = 20 to 30%.  so the load is not bad.
I would guess at your driver, but I use ATI I'm afraid
hmmm. I had same card (maybe same driver?) on Fedora - all worked fine!. snowblnik: Thanks for trying to help me! I will try mplayer forum.
Anyone know how to get sound working with ICH10?. I had it kind of working, it was very very choppy.
if you post an alsa bug they usually get back to you.  quickly

Hi all, has anyone ever had any problems with installing kernel modules while running ubuntu as a xen guest? they appear to be installing to /lib/modules/2.6.32-5-xen-amd64 instead of /lib/modules/3.2.0-32-generic (ubuntu 12.04 server LTS)
?
which part are you questioning? :)
my server is ubuntu and everytime I git pull i have to type the passphrase. Is there away for ubuntu to remember this passphrase permanently?
add you public key to the git server
oh.  thanks
easy enough :)
on my desktop i think i have gnome-keyring or something, i can't remember what i installed but i have to type the passphrase only ONCE every time i login
It depends what passphrase you mean then. If it's public_key pass then you must enter that each time it's used. If it's just your git access password, then setup a keypair on the server and upload the public key to the git server
it's the publickey pass
then it is how it should be. Unles you install gnome-keyring or similar on the server I guess
that's what i'm asking, i'm not sure what package it is
pam_gnome_keyring may have something to offer you. That's a starting point only though. I can't help any more http://is.gd/JKt7gd
thanks for ur help
so whenver I suspend or hibernate I have to shut the laptop off to get back into the OS because it doesn't wake up when I do something
suspend and hibernate have long been serious problems for linux on laptops--there are numerous bugs on launchpad about it
so is there anything I can do to get it working right?
http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/  you can add ideas you have about improving ubuntu here.  you can check the bugs at launchpad and see what ubuntuforums has to say but it is a case by case thing if it works or not--never been able to get it working myself
thanks bhazang. *
hi.. i've installed alsa-utils.. but cant find alsaconf
alsatools. or alsa-tools. whatever it may be
I cant find alsatools.. or with "-". .. but when I searched for alsaconf.. I got up: Note, selecting alsa-utils instead of alsaconf.  guys in #debian says alsaconf is missing..and wondring where it was gone:p.  *where it went*
alsaconf is needed to detect your soundcard and set it up
exactly.. but seems like its impossible to get hold of
probably its in the package alsatools
it dosnt exist any package named that
that IS new to me :s.  try alsa-base
E: Couldn't find package alsatools.  got that installed already... but as I said.. apt-get resolved alsaconf to alsa-utils.. but got that one installed as well
to install. and see if that has it
so.. seems like apt-get belives alsaconf is inside the alsa-utils package.. but it isnt
hi, When selecting the Audio/Output in the Multimedia Systems Selector, the only one that works is ESD, when I test with ALSA I get an error, does that mean that ALSA doesn't work correctly on my system?
the default sound system is esd. or esd with an alsa wrapper or somthing. basicly, it's esd
ok, and let's say I'd like to use ALSA, is it possible?
you can probably install any missing packages.  are you using the admin account?
: I'm using the account which was initially created during install
ok. just removing being in the wrong group as a reason not to work ;)
I think I need ALSA because I'd like to test a java application, and it looks like audio playback with java under linux requires ALSA
try with esd, if it doesnt work get the gstreamer plugins and switch to alsa
ESD sound works with music player, but not with the java app. sound is ok ... I'd just like to make sure ALSA works
its spanish
you know what to do now that you love it right? share it. Go to ubuntulinux.org and ask them to ship you some cd's, they'll do it for free. Then give them to all your friends.
i did it !!
Flight 4 broke the Netgear MA111 ndiswrapper driver
was that bug reported?
yes, but not by me.  i found it through a search
Is there a way to disable right-clicks?
why?
throwing a party and don't want to let anyone use anything but the music player (they love to sabotage)
I have two suggestions: 1) just use the guest session (when you logout all changes are lost) or 2) read the admin guide about locking down gnome (there are 2 documents, read them both) at library.gnome.org
about the guest session, exactly all changes? like browser bookmarks, filesystem, application settings etc
is there a live cd for macs?
i believe so let me check

it says bluetooth is disabled. i installed blueman it says bluez daemon is not running,blueman-manager cannot continue
Is there any output from 'lsmod|grep bluetooth' in your terminal?
yes.  no lsmod doesn't give anything. but lsusb gives
What about '/etc/init.d/bluetooth status'?.  Ok run 'sudo modprobe bluetooth' and pastebin if there is any error message
i did modprobe bluetooth..it dint produce any error. but there was no output too
Now check the output of 'lsmod|grep bluetooth' again. It should show the module is loaded.  No output typically means success
yes it came
Now do 'sudo service bluetooth start'
done service bluetooth start
And now restart sys>prefs>bluetooth and see what it says
bluetooth is disabled :(
when is Ubuntu 9.04 comming ?. so soon ?. nice, wonder if it will work better than 8.10 on my laptop
yeah  ; ubuntu has fixed release dates
hm hope that 3d acceleration will work better on 9.04 than on 8.10
what part to you mean  ?. DRI enabled by default and such ?
well inteldrivers suck. got the 965chipset
m yeah
dri enabled
intel isn't that open source if I'm not mistaken
dri enabled and glxgears gives me 70fps
anyway, running 9.04 here and it runs likea charm. 70 fps +. my god :p. gonna check how much it's here
fusion works like charm but when it comes to rotating it its gets under 25fps and wine works likes crap
I did apt-get install cron but the cron jobs still don't run anyone have a clue
is the cron service running?
yes
ok, how are you sure the jobs aren't being run?
i set a simple one in /etc/crontab * * * * * root /bin/touch /root/test.test and no luck
have you checked your mail (or root's mail) for any errors -- and btw, touch should be /usr/bin/touch
this is a new server and I have not installed any "mail" capabilities yet
every system has a mail reader to read local mail - it should be at /usr/bin/mail
your statement is not entirely accurate
regardless, have you checked your mail????
There are no errors not even in the log files
hey folks, how can I clear my mbr? I'm having an issue installing ubuntu that I have not had in the past with this very same cd, installer gets stuck on grub install.... anyone?
dd?.  what exactly do you want to do?
I want to do anything I can to ease the installation seeing as that it only goes as far as grub install now, and gets stuck there. So I thought perhaps clearing the mbr before installing might help.
I recently installed 9.04. When I go to the Pandora site, the browser locks. Any clues?
your flash player is the problem
ed - I installed the Adobe package and that helped a bit - now it loads for a few seconds then clocks out again.. I am running 9.04 on my Macbook. VMware is a wonderful thing!
I think that you have to purge all of your flash packages except for one (the one you intend to use)
ed - that's seems to be the consensus from everything I have found on the forums. But I don't have any other flash related programs installed. Perhaps an uninstall and a reinstall?
Hi, I'd like to know by what device name my cdrom drive goes... how can I find out?. Got IDE drives but dmesg shows a lot of SCSI messages
ls /sys/block
fd0 ram1 ram11 ram13 ram15 ram3 ram5 ram7 ram9 sdb sr1 ram0 ram10 ram12 ram14 ram2 ram4 ram6 ram8 sda sr0
sr0
thanks!
or sr1.  you have two cd/dvd drives?
yes
they are sr0 and sr1. your hard disks are sda and sdb.
why does ubuntu use scsi emulation?
sorry to bother, but what is the name of the package to install/configure what PHP5 extensions to install?. I see all the packages in the list when I apt-get, but isn't there like a package that installs/configures the PHP extensions?
extensions for what
php5. I'm so used to BSD I tend to get lost sometimes with the ubuntu packages & such..
extension for use with what?
extensions to use with php5. I want to install a bunch of extensions, but I don't want to install them all manually. I would prefer to install them from a config selection list or something and install that way.

hi, how is a digital camera listed under /dev/?
It's usually listed as a USB-attached device. Type lsusb to see it.
it's listed on lsusb but it doesn's show up on /dev/
is there an alternative for lm-sensors ? apt-get says that it is "referred to by another package" and "has no installation candidate"
what version of ubuntu?
nichomachus : Lubuntu 15.10
Seveas: I've just read your page about IRC rules and I've found something strange. In the section "when helping" you say installing support for encripted DVDs with install-scc.sh is a bad solution, but on the page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats#head-cd84b8e23927ccdb4bb55ffd3074687abec0cf3b It says exactly that. So,... I don't get it
I've talked with seveas about that (I put that link on the wiki :) . It's an older version of libdvdcss , but it's also the most stable location to get libdvdcss from
I think it's the only way to get it for amd64 :)
it may very well be. I don't have 64bit
so... the only problem is that it's outdated?
how do i calibrate my touch screen in lucid?

so I think I a really annoying bug in ubuntu 14.04. Do you all have the problem when you install ubuntu with LUKS full disk encryption that your keyboard drivers don't seem to load when you need to put your encryption password in?. yes
check your system BIOS for USB legacy support options. likely they are conflicting. or try a replug
tried replug. the numlock light stays on and none of the other keys respond.. Ill check BIOS settings though real quick.
i installed fluxbox, how can i go to synpatic ???????
gksudo synaptic
but how to go to terminal ?
it probably means wine is having some problems... the backgroud just kinda fades out right?
everything fades, it only changes when I run nvidia config. changes back* excuse me
k i know what u mean... do u have wine setup right?
as far as I know im not missing anything. ive set up wine before, and it worked fine.
hmm... i dont really use wine much so i dont really know, but i know whenever firefox hits a page with lazy coding it does the same thing.. do u have enough memory free?
I have 4 gigs of memory, on a fresh install
thats not the prob then... I really dont know, sorry k
Hey, I just ran out of space in virtualbox, is it possible to create one more virtual hard drive and add it to windows XP?
yeap, just like if you had bought one and added it to the mix, except its free
So, I made another virtual hard disk and added it in settings. Windows detects new hardware but does nothing
try ubuntu instead?
Ubuntu is host, I need to use some windows application so I have XP in virtualbox

what is the install dir?
Disk /dev/sdb: 320.0GB Disk identifier: 0x9e8be372 is what i get under fdisk. i need to put this drive in fsab
yessir?
klowner: im trying to add a drive to fstab so it l mount on startup
ok, so what part are you having trouble with?
klowner: well i just need to know what to put into fstab. /dev/sdb /media/NONE. thats all i know so far
do you actually want to mount it to /media/NONE or woudl something like... /mnt/externaldrive be more appropriate?
the drive is named none, and i already have samba shares set up with the name none so i would perfer to keep mounting it as NONE
ah, well ok
but what would i place after those lines? anything?
next step would be determining what filesystem is on the drive
how would i go about that, im guessing its ntfs but just to be sure
ah, if it's NTFS I would recommend installing ntfs-config.  it helps set up ntfs drives
ok installed, where do i go from there
run it, pop open a terminal and type ntfs-config
ok check the boxes enable write support for external device?

I'm having a problem with a fresh 12.04 alternate 32bit install, system with usb hd plugged in doesn't see it, after system is fully up i can manually replug it and then ubuntu will "see" it. I want to mount this usb hd to /usbhd at boot as to use it for a backup target destination. blkid doesn't see it until replug. uuid is strange all around, blkid and /dev/disk/by-uuid show it as "D6D4E78DD4E76E65 -> ../../sdc1"
see "/msg ubottu fstab"
: tried fstab by uuid and by /dev/sdc1, both fail. options tried so far "auto,hotplug,defaults 0 0"
is it ext2/3/4?
: mount -a only works after a replug of device.  : ntfs

I have a wireless-and-also-wired router. I, henceforth, want to connect to it with ethernet, and not wirelessly. How can I disable the wireless of my pc? (I don't even want roaming mode to be on, because it connects to other networks.)
blacklist the module :-).  remove the card from motherboard..  set it up not to connect.
Isn't there a more elegant way? :P.  how?

Is this the right way of setting a kernel parameter in Ubuntu?: sudo sysctl -w i8042.nopnp=1
: nope.  are you using grub or grub2?
Grub 2 (Ubuntu 9.10).  I've looked at /etc/grub.d/10_linux but it looked like pure detection code, no static entry as far as I could see
sudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg
That file is generated by update-grub
then locate the line kernel and add your parameters: kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.28-15-generic root=UUID=7bb5d8e8-0833-4525-bea2-e871b46c1493 RO i8042.nopnp=1 i8042.dumbkbd=1
Those settings would disappear the next time update-grub is executed (kernel upgrades etc.)

try running: killall -9 vlc in the terminal.  vlc has a bug that, sometimes if it's killed via xkill, it will still remain as a running process in the background. you can test this, if you run 'ps aux | grep vlc'
it said "no process killed"
run that ps aux | grep vlc

im installing ubuntu to a seperate external hard drive-- what device do a choose for the boot loader, the external or my main drive with windows?
if you want to boot it by choosing the external drive in your bios boot menu, then install it to the external drive. Installing it to the internal drive will require that drive to be connected any time you want to boot windows
thanks, so installing it to the external would make me have to boot it from the bios every time? Is there a quicker way?

why ssh service starts during booting? I checked with sysv-rc-conf, it is not enabled. Why?
Checked /etc/init/ssh.conf ?
oh I see.  How to disable it?
Comment out the 'start on' section.
so Ubuntu does not honor sysv runlevel system, I should not count on what I see in sysv-rc-conf, right?
Ubuntu uses upstart, but I believe it still uses runlevels.
Is there a tool for /etc/init like sysv-rc-conf for /etc/init.d?.  how can I know what services is enabled and what is not?
initctl list ?
How can I configure what services to start ?

hey guys, i just installed karmic my wireless is working great on gnome, but i just installed e17, wireless doesn't seem to work any ideas ?
e17 doesn't start network manager applet would be my guess, so you don't get a connection.
k lemme try starting it.  ermm how i start the network manager applet manualy ?
I just hinted at the answer: not worth finding out. Just use GNOME :)
i wanna use e17,
but if you are adventurous, try "nm-applet" from command line. It either starts or fails..  or maybe it's called network-manager-applet or Network-Manager-applet. I'm not quite sure what they call that little thing.
nm-applet it is.  well i guess its running, but since i can't see it anywhere hehehe
if it starts, then good. You can probably force it to start somehow at beginning of session. If it doesn't work, you're probably out of luck with respect to that..  and I state again: don't use e17. It's stupid.. Not supported. Nonsense. Just wastes time.
hmm.  ok, can ya help me on a related topic ?/.  if i don't wanna use nm=applet for using my wireless on gnome, what are the alternatives ?
By the way, is e17 the enlightenment version they've been working on for at least 5 years? Or is it more now?
i tried wicd on gnome, it detected by wireless, but never connected, it authenticated etc. but always got stuck on the getting ip address part.  hehe no idea

Why 8.8.8.8?. 8.8.8.8 doesn't have no log policy
it's google's public DNS
Google doesn't have no log policy
my guess is, Cox is redirecting genio's URL's.  log policy?
I am saying, meanying, every website you visit the query DNS on Google public DNS is logged
who cares? If you don't like it, don't use it.
So, imho, it's unsafe to always point folks to Google Publis DNS
you are right. It is your opinion.
You are right, you don't care about your anonymity but it's foolish to assume others don't
If I connect a USB - serial adapter. Which would be the address to get to the serial port?. would it be /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyUSB0?
if it works, i think it should be something like /dev/ttyUSB0
What do you mean - if it works?
well, i mean the adapter might not be recognized... but hopefully it will
dmesg says: http://paste.ubuntu.com/358077/
then it should definitely be recognized at /dev/ttyUSB0
So I can tell other software that they can find the serial device in /dev/ttyUSB0?
yes.
The problem Is I have connected a weather station to that port. But when I run wview and tell it to use this address, the daemons start, but it says its still starting. and I cant get it to work.. Like it would be waiting for some packets ir sth :S
it might be waiting for some flow control signal that never gets activated. have a look at the flow control options. you should probably also try debugging using the package "minicom" (a simple terminal emulator)
what is flow control, and what exactly do I have to try? Sorry i'm such a newbie.. I just really want to set up the weather station..
it might end up being a bit complicated. serial ports (the RS232 interface) have a pin or two that are used to say "yes, i'm here, i'm a serial device, and i'm ready to send/receive". those are called RTS/CTS (ready to send / clear to send). alternatively, another method of flow control is called XON/XOFF, and doesn't use any additional pins.  it's possible, for example, that your program expects RTS/CTS signals, but those aren't carried by the adapter.
I just installed minicom. What can I do with it?
how you would tell your software to ignore them... i don't know that..  you can try to see the raw output that's coming from the serial port, if any.
how do I change the port on minicom?
i don't really remember these details
Ok. then how do I see what information is it sending?
how can i install new icon ?
right click, create launcher
i have install new icon, but how to install?. i have download a new icon, but how to use it?, sry did write wrong, my bad
anyone know whats up with my problem then

group/id.  groups/id

I installed a couple .deb packages and rebooted only to get "Mount of filesystem failed" as I'm dropped to a maintenance shell. How do I uninstall the packages from this shell or from a live cd?. tried the usual commands from removing them from the maintenance shell to no avail and I don't know how to remove packages from an installed system with a live cd
It'sprobably not the packages that are wrong per see, but the filesystem that's messy
everything was working famously until I installed those. which was the only change I had made prior to the last reboot it had
It may be that in the process of writing exposed something corrupt in the filesystem, or a bd block on the disk...
and I will certainly look into that after removing those packages. XD. just to be certain
You will probably need to get around the filesystem errors first, the package problem is secondary in this case...  The filesystem which has failed, are there critical data on it?
I'm still not convinced that installing a package uncovered some underlying problem. there must be a way to uninstall a package with a live cd, chroot perhaps?
who is good at debugging "gdm" it reports to start [ok] but all i get out of it is, it starts x to the cursor and then x exits. no error messages, nothing. (btw startx works for all accounts) ?. also it's not a free space issue, i already checked that.
what was recorded in this file: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
nothing useful. it's not an x error.  x is working fine, but gdm wont run
then you've checked that you can get to working gnome session with startx?
yes, already mentioned that.. who is good at debugging "gdm" it reports to start [ok] but all i get out of it is, it starts x to the cursor and then x exits. no error messages, nothing. (btw startx works for all accounts) ?. repost ^
greetings earthlings. how can I use the '. sorry, the 'dd' command to clone a partition?
dd if=/dev/source of=/dev/target
and, thank you for your answer about cloning. the /dev/source I will want to use the actual parititon, right? as in /dev/sdc1 to /dev/sdd1 ... correct?
correct. so something like dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1
ok, thanks. just wanted to be sure. for some reason I haven't had much luck with this so far.
partitions are the same size?
well, not yeat. *yet.  do they need to be?. I thought perhaps it would kill the partition on the 2nd drive ie overwrite it
target should be equal or greater
ok. I can do that.
did you get any error message? you said you 'haven't got any luck'? What happened?
I repartitioned the target drive and now (I hope) the partition is being cloned; I had trouble coming up with the correct "dd" command for some reason - part of the problem was the drive was dying. whenever I set out to make a 3rd back up for offsite invariably the original drive starts to die. it's just weird.

how does VPN affect bandwidth? Does it require alot more of it, or?
depends on what you're doing
VNC over VPN for instance.. Does it slow it down significantly?
depending on your bandwidth, rdesktop could slow things down a bit. what's your bandwidth?. you have pptp and ipsec for VPNs as well. ipsec offers much more security but is more difficult to set up under linux
I'm actually thinking more in general.
Is debian "Pin" in /etc/apt/preferences honoured by "Software Updates"?
yes
Thanks.
works just the same
kernel -25 is killing me, and I keep getting caught out with software updates :-).  Get a stable system going, "la de da - software updates" - Oh holy smurf!
iirc having either linux-image-<arch> or linux-<arch> is what pulls in the new kernels, with out those no new kernels
Without those in pref? Surely you need to exclude them using prefs rather than include them?
my system wants to open php files with bluefish editor
-> what does your /etc/mime.types for php tells you?
application/x-httpd-php phtml pht php
theres more lines with php
http://paste.ubuntu.com/118993/
same as mine
ah ok.  this is really odd IMO
-> are you typing file:///fullpathtofile ? notice the 3 ///
yes i did have 3 '/'
and what does your about:config tells you under mime ?
can't copy and paste the values.  but ive got 3 lines that filter on mime
you can tell me, itheres only two lines
/etc/mime.types, and ~/.mime.types
gentoo has java-select for this, which is neat.
coudn't it be installed in /opt or something?
there are a load of symlinks in /etc/alternatives. but I'm not sure if there's an automagical way to manage them
is there anybody here would like to help me ?
just ask
i dont know what's going on with this version : 12.04 : << ehh it seems i am done
ask your question
i have too many issues , i installed dockbarx and i doesnt work too , i installed ubuntu tweak but i can not see gnome sitting dont tell me search cos if you said that i will break this screen
where did you get dockbarx
from that site gnome.look.org. i installed it in version 10.04 it works + its great there
if you are new to linux i would recommend you get all software from the software center
well that's okay but i can't find what i want in software center not all the time !
its free
so i dont think there's answer for my question. that's why people call ubuntu truck then
anyone know how to access files copied onto a usb drive formatted to ext3? they seem to be encrypted or something

So if I install Gnome-core. will it allow me to use a different desktop?. UvC5x3mX2u. https://askubuntu.com/questions/228503/is-it-possible-to-use-multiple-desktop-environments-on-same-system
that url is from 2012 .. use ubuntu gnome desktop. https://askubuntu.com/questions/766071/install-gnome-shell-on-ubuntu-16-04
shoot. I'm already installing ubuntu. err. gnome. I already entered sudo apt-get install gnome-core. should I just delete it after it is done running?. in the console?. because it is at like 58%
gnome-core is not that bad, but the -desktop is rich with programs. !info gnome-core. 'essential' so you can add all you favorite programs, and keep it small. gnome-core would be my ( experienced) choise
Sooo
sooo, your good :-)
so there is functionally no difference between gnome-core. and ubuntu-gnome-desktop. ?
just the amount of programs standard
Oh.... I've already installed a bunch of programs. will I have to reinstall them in gnome desktop?

I just installed 9.04 freshly and I try playing music and it seems like the music is slow and at a lower tone. any help on tht?
you probably need restricted media plugins maybe. that is just a guess
i thin kit already downloaded and installed tht on its own
hmmm.  have you rebooted or logged out since it installed that package ?
umm no i dont thin kso
try rebooting or logging out and see if it changes anything
you think I should try rebooting?. ok ill check
if it does not then there may be another issue. sometimes it fixes things
ok let me try that
it may or may not work. worth a try though
hopefully it does =/
I have put a bootable version of ubuntu on a 250GB external USB hard drive...I can boot it fine into my machince, when I am in ubuntu, it keeps sayin I am out of disc space, but the external hard drive is wide open
the separate drive is not the same as your ubuntu machine it won't use that separate drive/volume as main storage -- the disk space required for your OS must be on your main machine (it doesn't count if it's on the external drive). the usb drive is a separate mount. you need more disk space on the main machine -- or possibly put the swap onto the external usb drive but i'm not sure how you would configure that -- swap is disk buffering the OS requires to run if you only have a small amount of memory
thank you for your response about my memory problem. I figured it had something to do with the external drive.... I do not have a HDD, and that is why I am booting ubuntu from a flash drive

anybody here who can help me using my logitech cam with skype in 10.04?
have you cheese installed?
yes
does your webcam work with cheese?
it captures the input, yes, but CPU is up to 100%, so it is practically useless
did you try to run cheese on terminal to see if you get any strange output?
i get some warnings and an error
and if you run skype on terminal, do you get similar error?
no.  this is what i get with cheese: http://paste.ubuntu.com/489302/
do you know what is that file cheese tries to open?
it seems an ogg video, i don't know why it wants to open that, the Reason translates as: the data stream does not contain any data.  i've deleted all items, now cheese does not give any output in terminal
and does it consume too much cpu?
yes.  around 90%
so no error nor warning but still consuming too much cpu?
exaclty

No I actually would rather have sun
Is there a god tutorial about configuring apache and ubuntu to have for each user a subdomain, web-data in the home folder, maybe with bash scripts ? With all permissions and so on... Would be awesome!
i don't think apache can do that by default... you could set up virtual hosts on a per-user basis, or auto-gen config files, but i dunno if it will just do it automagically.  but i could be wrong, you should read here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_userdir.html#userdir.  in fact i thinki am wrong and you can just do UserDir http://*.foo.com/
Okay, im gonna have a look at that... But the whole folder permissions system, and that every user has his data with his permissions in his home folder?
oh wait, but that'll just redirect.... hrm.
Just so I could create users with their own filders

Hi im trying to get my display setup correct i have a nvidia gforce fx5500 (the drivers are installed correctly) with a samsung Syncmaster 172v monitor, i have entered the correct vert and horiz values but still the display has a ghosted image to the right ive tried differant refresh rates too, any help would be great.
how long is your video cable?
Not very long, why?
a long cable can cause ghosting ... as can a cheap cable. make sure the cable isnt running near any power cables aswell
It was ok in windows, about 30 mins ago.
have you tried using the nv driver - does it still have ghosting?
yes it does. im sure it has something to do with the horiz and vert values i have set, but they seem to have worked last time.. and they are the correct values from the monitor manual.
what resolution are you running?
1280x1024. at 60hz
is it ghosting @ 800x600
No not at all. Perfect Display at 800x600
then i'm guessing either the refresh isnt high enough or the screen cant handle 1280x1024
it must be the refresh but i have had it working before in ubuntu with 1280x1024 @60hz. this is what i cant understand
my boot drive is shown as unknown in gparted and i get grub eroor17 at boot what is happening?

Hey everyone.  u there. oh there ya are I got a crazy question kinda looking at something and wonder if this is possible. can I do a symlink from a file to a kernel module. because  that is what it seems to be doing ...
Um...I'm lost - wassup?
yank you ever heard of a module being linked like a shortcut to a file
yes
ahhh you know how that command would go?.  I'm pretty much working with a user manual and trying to figure out how this thing works
You'd use "ln" to accomplish this task...but be ABSOLUTELY sure of things...mucking about with symbolic links can get, er, a bit puzzling at times...especially if you're not taking notes (somewhere)
Yeah I know ln does get interesting, and I am taking notes, it's for work so everything is being documented.
bliss1: toilet problems
they just look at the screen when they see me come on , cause they all like me, heheahahah
well Ii would have never known hehehehe

I have a computer that updated from 11.04 to 11.10 they did not back anything up and it crashed after 11.10 was installed. They recovered the system however now they cannot find anything in the Var/www folder and now asking me to find the files for them. Is there any simple way to find these lost files?
for a start, type locate index.htm
from terminal?
yes
good lord.. maybe i should have |less'd that....  k, now what?
ctrl-c to stop it
it finished already.
see if you find what you're looking for. in that list

I have a theoretical question: can I give a program the right to-read write and execute just in a given folder. But at the same time it can't alter certain group of files even after reading them?. is this possible. please ready need your opinion. thanks
sure, you can run the program as a user that has those permissions.  make sure the user doesn't own the dir, that way he can't delete the file and recreate it (i think having just w to the dir you can't delete stuff, try it and see)
but what stops the program from renaming it the said files after reading then- note this user has: read write and execute permission in this folder.  he might not have permission to delete it, but once it can read the file and it has a write permission why can't it just make a copy of it with another another name?
yeah i just tried it, having rwx to a dir lets you delete the files if you want.  maybe just give him access to a subdir that he can create files in and possibly delete or rename?
so no solution even a theoretical solution/suggestion?.  let me try to tell what we are working on
well, you can do sudo chattr +i /path/to/file to make it immutable. he can't delete or rename it then or chattr -i it, i've not done this before so ask around before depending on it maybe
it's theory on how to protect the entry files from manipulation by a rough AI, which is just a smart program that has read permission to a given folder.  but it can make copies and rename them right? then we still have a problem
it's becoming inconsistent though, what you're asking
I now chattr -i I don't it would help
you want him to be able to read files, and you want to give him write permission to the dir, then logically he can read/copy it and make another file with another name
no it's not

can you telnet to a4 port 6010?
connection refusd
Then your X server is probably only listening on the localhost interface. Most are configured that way these days.
i dunno why my $DISPLAy is set to a4:10.0...earlier it was localhost:10.0.  i am using xming for xforwarding
Can you telnet to localhost port 6010 then?
unable to connect to loalhost. localhost*. cd ..
hmm

hi guys i need help
just ask your question.
i am using 2 OS on 2 seperate harddrive now, one is windows xp, the other is ubuntu
sooo....data recovery...... :|
reiser, has a little known special bonus for using it.
what would that be,
Anybody know a switch/option to drop the date/time from ls -l?
I don't think so. But maybe you could pipe together two commands to get the desired results. :)
I'll make an alias _if_ i can figure that out.
I'll look into it, too.
Sweet.
Hmm...difficult problem this.
Aye. it is.
Just out of curiosity. Why do you want it that way? As in what data do you want to view?
Superfilus & extenoius data I wish to filter out from my constant ls -l 's.
is there non-freesoftware in ubuntu?. i am concerned about my privacy.
lots
it isnt safe then. right

when I run alt+f2 to launch an application, what paths does it look for applications in?
whatever is in your $PATH
I respectfully disagree :)
/bin;/usr/bin;/usr/local/bin;/sbin;/usr/sbin I'd assume
or maybe not. I have set stuff in my .bashrc that it doesn't use. where do I need to set it?
how are you setting your path in .bashrc?
PATH=/usr/lib/kde4/bin:$PATH, and export PATH
export PATH=/usr/lib/kde4/bin:$PATH
that's the same I think. at least the path works like it should in a shell

does anyone know what this means? FPS not specified in the header or invalid, use the -fps option ?. I got the output from mplayer
It means "use the -fps" option :P.  FPS stands for frames per second
as in in the terminal?
Yep
do I need to specify frames per second?
Apparently. What is it you're trying to do?
or just mplayer filename -fps.  trying to play a m2ts file.  when I try to play it without the option I get audio but not visual
It says the header information is invalid or missing, so it may be that the file is screwed up.  Have a look at this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1045394

hmm.. let me have a quick look at the man page.. just a sec
any idea?
How come I can only choose 43 or 47 Hertz' refresh rate when I pick resolutions above 1024x768?
chetic maybe because your monitor doesn't supports this rate on hight resolution
it does, without any doubt whatsoever.. I've used it for years
chetic maybe the driver is old
same with 1024x768, it can do more than 60Hz but that's all I can choose.. well that and 43.  I just downloaded and installed the driver! if you mean the graphics driver

I just created a reiserfs drive, but when I added it to /etc/fstab and rebooted my computer it won't let me write to it, I have it set to use defaults, any ideas on what to change?. do I change that in the fstab?
no, let's check what's wrong first..  is it mounted readonly? The last line of output from 'mount' should tell you
how do I get output from mount? -v?
no parameters
/dev/hda4 on /media/xtra type reiserfs (rw)
ubuntu randomly crashes right?

Does anyone know how to fix the Gtk 32 bit module loader problems in jaunty? Here is the error message: Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module": /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/modules/libcanberra-gtk-module.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
hold on checking
thanks. I've been googling around but not sure where the symbolic link's broken for gtk
do you have libcanberra0 installed?.  also libcanberra-gtk0 libcanberra-gtk-module and related dev pacakges
I have libcanberra pre-installed with jaunty 64 bit. it's under /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/modules.
mm let me search more hold on
the first problem I've encountered is the 32-bit flash plugin complains about wrong ELF class for this module which I think it is a 64 bit module.
are you running 64 but?. bit. sorry
yes I am. Jaunty 64 bit. I did have ia32libs installed and they seem to work fine
I am seeing many hits in google about this but no solutions have you tried ##gnome?
i did. tried to figure this out for the past weeks but no dices. it seems like gtk 2.0 for jaunty 64 bit is broken somewhere..  this also affects chromium browser.
oh man... I have no experience with the 64 bit at all ...here...all my systems are 32 bit.... I will keep searching.  yes I read a bug report about chromium as well.  check this http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10886.  sorry no solution there hold on
yep, same problems. Someone told me to hang on and wait for the updates for the Gtk. currently i can't run any gtk based 32-bit applications in jaunty.
oh man...that's painful :(.  I am still searching though
thanks  for helping out. What I am trying to do now is to find out where it tells gtk to find the modules. If I can find out where the configuration file is, maybe I can tweak a little bit to let it find the 32-bit version.
sounds reasonable
kind of regret of upgrading to jaunty from fedora. didn't expect an error like this.
would sudo ldconfig help?
tried that, no entries for loading module section.
darn.  well I havent used fedora for some time so I cant speak about the differences ...you probably see them immediately
i like ubuntu for the easy installation but it just happens that the 9.04 seem to have some problems i guess. it uses python2.6 instead of python2.5 in ubuntu. All my old apps were based on 2.5. So I had to do some seriously tweaking to make jaunty work..  but the fast boot up is impressive~ thanks to kernel 2.6.28
that almost sounds useless... did you consider going back to fedora until 9.10?.  oh :).  did you say you had all of the -dev pacakges installed for libcanberra?
well, already spent so much time tweaking jaunty. will try to stick around for a little longer. hope that doesn't happen. :-)
understood :)
yep, the whole gtk packages including dev version.
running ubuntu 11.10; i'm trying to change my name servers. /etc/resolv.conf appears to be re-generated on re-boot. 1) how do i permanently change my name servers? 2) if i want to cache name servers on my box for faster internet access how would i do that?
it's set every time you connect to your network, you need to edit the settings via network manager to make them take effect every time
i want to do it for all networks; i'm travelling; so i'm connecting to new networks daily
then you'll need to edit /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf so it'll be applied for all networks
that ges regenerated daily doesnt it.  after i change that how do i get networking to restart so that it will use the new name servers?
umm, is it possible to edit Sessions manually?
sure, create desktop files yourself
what do you mean? I want to stop amarok from starting up at boot, but I can't find it in the Sessions gui thing

can we install multiple deb files together??
yes
can u plz give me the command??
Hi, is it possible to fix bug with "Human-Murrine" on beta?

did you know about #ubuntu-ru ? you may want to try them first, if they don't help you, try here
does it matter?.  yes I know about ubuntu-ru. they know nothing about this problem, so I decided to ask here
it doesn't matter, but your question was hard to understand..  can you explain your question better?
sorry, I thought it's a know issue on a 8.10 better
what ubuntu are you using, what did you do, what happened, what did you expect should happen
http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ubuntu-8-10-Alpha-4-Screenshot-Tour-91907.shtml here is the description of new ubuntu 8.10 and they say about a bug with gnome look. I have the same, but has not found how to fix it.
Ok I have a difficult problem. I need to install apache offline. How in the world can I download all the dependencies for it easily?
try http://ubottu.com/ljl/apt/
so those are all the dependencies I must download?
Make sure that you put in the meta-package that you have.
then I just do dpkg -i * for all of those dependencies?
Yes.
what is a meta package?
A package that doesn't contain any data itself, but just depends on other packages. So for a desktop install, it would be ubuntu-desktop.
this thing isn't making a whole lot of sense. It is telling me I need to download a .deb, but I know those debs have dependencies.
So what did you enter in the fields?
for example I need to install package apache2-mpm-worker (it's one of apache2's dependencies) and the metapackage for all apache is apache2
Is there a bultin gtalk in ubuntu or do i have to install it?

gtalk? it is not gtalk it is only empathy.
well the account i meant
switch means? you can enable or disable them. you can know chich contacct in online from which account
ah ok there was none online from the gtalk account, silly me
I just upgraded to 11.10 from 11.04, my wireless doesn't work anymore.. and my fonts are ugly.. Did it remove proprietary software or something?
Maybe the default font has changed and the anitaliasing settings are different
What about wireless?. It worked on 11.04, it doesn't work now.
If a program (Pidgin in this case) is locking up and needs killed, is there a way to see what was causing it through Ubuntu?
I don't think so
thanks
if it keeps locking, you can try running it under a debugger. but as far as checking on a past event, I don't think so
where can I go to learn about running it under a debugger? I can debug it no problem once I get it going, but getting it set up is where I'm lost.
man gdb

Anyone know a program to re-encode mp3s at a lower bitrate?

they're listed under places. Yes, I'm using Gnome
hi. the mac address allocated by ubuntu to eth0 and wlan 0, is it safe enouth to keep as it is? or is it recommended to change to custome?. help
the mac address is set on the card not by ubuntu.  do you mean the ip address?
i see. no i mean mac address
?
so my mac address for my wlan and eth comes assigned from the manufacturer?
mac addresses are hard coded into the cards by the manufacturer.  yes
okay. thanks.
what are you trying to do?.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address.  the ip address is different
i was just want to know that the default mac address assigned by manufature is enoush secure? because if we get combination permutation then there will be limited number of addresses? (as we end with ip address) so then it may happen that two or more devices may have same mac addresses?.  i know.  i am not talking about ip i am talking about mac
it doesn't matter in that regard.  unless you have trillions of network devices all on the same network
okay
Any of you guys installed Lyx here?

can anyone tell me why samba 3.5.8 has a failure to switch to the proper username upon making new files/folders but everything else works?
are you forcing a user in the share parameters?
yea it gives me an error in my log about switching to that user.
does that user exist and have an smbpass created?
yea user erin was created and did smbpasswd -a.  [2011/10/10 18:20:43.439308, 0] smbd/uid.c:310(change_to_user). PANIC: assert failed at smbd/uid.c(310): conn->force_group_gid != (gid_t)-1
ah ok, that's about the extent of my knowledge then, assuming you've restarted tha daemon since and also tried testparm for a laugh
it's ok I can just change the permissions on ssh I guess. seems like a bug in the software ( I did see it but they said something about the gid bit on some directory caused it however I don't really know what that means.
does that user, erin, have read permissions on the share path?
yea ;/ the dir is owned by x:x but it is 777
erk =E tried forcing the owner to erin:erin just for a test?
nah, im just going to be storing a few images of hard drives so I can chang the permissions to -w or whatever manually later. it needs to be x:x since it stores movies etc for my home theater ;\
ah ok. i do the same thing by having the group owner as a group "server" that all the users are a member of
hrm.. what ? :-). I usually use nfs but my gf insists on having a windows computer so I gotta use samba too -.-
so say i want 3 users on something, the permissions are 760 or 660, with owner nobody:group - where "group" = "server". then, the share in the samba config has a parameter "forcegroup = server" and "createmask = 0660" or so to force it
uh, so have the group of the file the name of my server machine, like (Media)?
Hello. I've got a problem with the nvidia driver: http://nopaste.info/3f038cd0e5.html. This is the newest version (260.19.12) from ppa (the stable does not work too). The machine locks up if i start xorg (this stacktrace is from a ssh connection)
have you ruled out bad hardware?
the machine is a new one, the vesa driver works (but 800x600 is not funny) and the previously installed windows worked too

ok, thanks... I am going to give grsync a try

Hello I have a netbook / tablet pc. on the screen I have a hardware button meant for screen rotation. How can i catch its keypress (most likely a multimedia like key) when pressed to run a command ( my screen rotation script ). I guess i first need to find out what the keypress code is. Any help ?
If you're using Gnome/Unity, there is an app called "Keyboard Shortcuts", in XFCE it's called just "Keyboard". Go there and create a new shortcut. It's straightforward really, define command, press key
tnaks i did try that, but It doesn't seem to register the key ( ubuntu / unity)
Hm... I dunno, go to xev, see if pressing it actually generates any X event
ahhhh xev that was the name i was tring to remember :P. thanks.  first time i get the right answer by asking the wrong question hahaha
lol
wow xev didnt react to the keypress, I may need a driver or something
flash games or HULU not working. after upgrade
already installed flashplugin-nonfree?
i went to synaptec and it says its already installed...  well it says flash is already installed.  , just installed it now.. should i reboot?
usually reboots are only necessary after deep system updates... i would recommend you try it with google chrome, which has a own flash builtin
just did, didnt work.
ok. Next step i would recommend is starting browser by terminal and check for error-messages / warnings
(firefox-bin:2658): LIBDBUSMENU-GTK-CRITICAL **: dbusmenu_menuitem_property_set_shortcut: assertion `gtk_accelerator_valid(key, modifier)' failed
otherwise... well... maybe delete flash-profile? ($HOME/.adobe/...) reinstall flashplugin?.  doesn't sound like a relevant error.  which ubuntu btw? 64bit?
, yes 64bit

XChat is very good ...
For lots of applications I get: error while loading shared libraries: liblzma.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. Ubuntu has no /usr/lib which seems to confuse the linker.. What's the idea behind that?
@ for liblzma.so.2, you probably just have to install the liblzma2 package. as for /usr/lib/, Ubuntu certainly does have it ...does your Ubuntu system not have /usr/lib ?. (that would be bad...)
and how do I get it?.  apt-get install liblzma2 => not found

Hello. Hello. I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 and I have an issue when it comes to boot/reboot. I have an Intel HD4000 and AMD Radeon 7730M (using propietary drivers). Whenever I reboot, it just goes to a black screen with underscore for a few minutes then goes back to login screen.
did you upgrade or clean install?
Clean install with the help of hachre
Ecryption: did it fail on you with the default drivers on setup?
No it didn't. I just wanted to use the proprietary drivers. After I rebooted, Unity wouldn't show up. After a lot of help it finally did. Now when I reboot, it doesn't reboot like it should.
how about trying the recovery from grub
It doesn't show grub at all.
you can hold shift after bios post boot. to enter grub
Yeah that's the problem, no BIOS post. It just stays on a black screen with underscore when I reboot so I can't do anything.
no bios post doesnt relate to ubuntu, you should at least see post msg boot on your machine right
Nothing like that.
did you recently added new hardware on your machine?
When I click reboot, it doesn't shutdown to reboot. There's just a black screeen with an underscore. It says like that for a few minutes then goes back to login screen.. Nope I haven't.
can you see ubuntu boot or not?
Nope I don't see it boot
try hold shift after you press power on your machine to enter grub, see what happens
I can't shutdown either. If I try to, it's just a blackscreen with an underscore

I was turning on my comp and I got GRUB error 13, I saw this means unsopported format. My hdd certainly isnt dead, I can read its contents from the LiveCD. any suggestions for fixing this?. yes
i think you should run grub from your live cd ... set root (hd x,y) setup (hd x) (where x = hard drive # and y = partition #) both 0 based
can you explain how to do this. I'm pretty familiar with linux by now but I dont know what you mean by that

Hi, How do I change grub booting options? I installed Fedora10 & now it boots from the partition sda5. my Ubuntu is on sda9 and I want my pc to boot from ubuntu's menu.lst , not fedora's. Does "root (hd0,8)" suffice or do I also need to use the command "setup (hd0,8)"? Any ideas how to go forward without losing Ubuntu's menu.lst ?
you'd have to reinstall GRUB then. Why not copy the ubuntu file over the fedora file?
when updating, ubuntu sometimes makes change to menu.lst (new kernel etc), so I don't think that'll work if I just copy the menu.lst.
fair enough. Here is a (very old) guide on restoring grub: http://www.sorgonet.com/linux/grubrestore/
ok, i'll check it out. thank you
Anyone know how to use iwconfig?

THERE Is no way to add a filetype to associate in Firefox, is that a bug?
click on that filetype and then when the prompt comes up asking you what to do, tell it.  there is no way to just go into it and add. You have to actually have come upon that filetype before
I have, repeatedly.
what filetype are you talking about
rtsp
ok and what is the problem
basically it says "Firefox doesnt know what to do because the protocol rtsp isnt associated with a program". no option to choose.  no option to choose nothing.
get mozilla-mplayer
Its an alert message.  I have that installed.
link to such an rtsp
http://www.cspan.org/ go to "recent programs". under "video/audio"
I get a prompt that comes up and tells me it is an external protocol and asks me if I want to open it with totem and whether I want to associate it with totem automatically from now on.  do you have totem all codeced ought
I uninstalled totem. no totem
well do you have something that can handle it
I installed realplayer. you know the one who made rtsp
guys I just did "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get upgrade" and apt manager before was saying there was 40+ updates now it says there is 7 still left wtf? will I always have to use that apt manager notifier in the corner?
maybe those updates require a dist-upgrade
ok so how would I do them using apt-get command?
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
thanks.  I think its working :)
:)
would it be correct to write:" apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade" ?
how can i find out what version of a package apt-get would install without installing it?
apt-cache policy packagename
the line in that that says 'candidate'?

you can change software sources in those settings
,the wire speed is not very stable.  which resource is quick?
go into system-->administration-->software sources and reset there if you wish.  the TW mirrors are always fast
oh like 8.10and 8.04
yes, they are always fast
,but it's updating now ,i can't change
from which mirrors

well sounds like you know what your doing :) on board raid can be more than enough for most recovery scenarios, i guess im just saying LVM offers a level of disk fluidity thats a nice to ahve
14 gameservers, 1 DNS+gateway+mail, 6 at work (SQL, LDAP, Web, Mail, DNS, CUPS) with hardware RAID, offsite backups every 2 hours) and 3 at home for various things *cough*, and now I'm installing the new server for the apartment complex.  yeah, I should probably learn more about it.  I never get the time to learn though... I'm so busy just keeping all the servers up and maintaining all the services
thats always the problem, vmware helps a lot though if you just want to play
I could talk to you about the gameservers and how they are connected to an SMS gateway (as in cellphone textmessages), keeping track of payments, activating gameservers and stopping them on time, rsync setups and so on. oh

I have, it is a real pain!
what do you folks use to create UEFI bootable USB sticks with Ubuntu installer on them?. and is there a way to allow both Windows 8 and Ubuntu installers to co-exist on the same USB stick with UEFI?
yes there are multi iso loaders to usb's.  the usb is not a uefi
if I create a win8 usb installer, then use YUMI to add Ubuntu, it ALWAYS goes directly to win8, with secure boot on.  with UEFI that is
I believe this app will install in fedora, I use this for my usb iso loading, it has W8 and many linux iso's loaded.. http://www.pendrivelinux.com/multiboot-create-a-multiboot-usb-from-linux/.  uefi is the computer setup the usb need just be a fat32 like usual.
yeah, I get that, I just don't know why it always goes to Windows 8 installer. The only way to get it into the YUMI grub menu is going back to legacy
been awhile since I used yumi, you confined to what OS for loading the ISO's?
only have windows 8 running at the moment
how can i make indicator applets.. i mean like the wifi or battery information using python?. <> how can i make indicator applets.. i mean like the wifi or battery information using python?
`upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0`.  That's so you can check power status via terminal. From there you should have enough info to monitor/display battery status in python.
i want to write my own indicatir applet. what library do i have to use? (Python)
how do you downgrade 14.04.2 to 14.04.1 or plain 14.04?
No downgrading system wide.
thanks... it'd be nice if canonical could just announce on their download page that they completely broke a particular version for use with vbox before people waste hours downloading, installing, configuring things, and then trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with guest additions
I would prefer it rain polkadots and moonbeams, either is about equal to happen. ;)
yeah, unfortunately... thanks again though
Is there a package for the Android SDK?
nope.  you have to install manually
Thanks

the nautilus eject wouldn't worked so I kill -9'd it and then I was able to eject my audio CD. Jun 13 18:38:38 localhost kernel: program eject is using a deprecated SCSI ioctl, please convert it to SG_IO

hello, what's the current way to execute a command as root when a particular user logs in to his desktop session?
a script in their ~/.config/autostart/ directory is one way
I need it to be executed as root
so use sudo/gksudo in the script
but then it will ask for the password?
what do you need ran exactly?.  not if you configure /etc/sudoers correctly
sudo nvclock -n 630 -m 610 -f.  of course, thanks
can the ubuntu installer coexist with a windows XP installation?

hi i'm looking for a php based stuff that implements a sort of wget based download queue, so that downloads are done in the server and clients can submit their url through a web interface.. does a thing like this exist?
if you know php, you could easily build something like that using the php "exec" command. This command provides shell interface that would allow you to use the actual wget command
yes i was planning to to it by myself but i'd like to know if this already existed to not duplicate the work :)
does anyone heard about ubuntu installation not showing disk with vista partition on it?

the DRM in amarok won't allow it
that sucks :(

Hey! I need help setting up a VPN server. Something simple would be amazing. OpenVPN is far too finicky and I feel like an idiot when I'm trying to set it up. I've seriously never used it correctly. I even tried a PPTP guide and that didn't work! Ugh...I'm ready to give up.
I thinl openvpn is one of the easier ones. think
it's super fiddly with all of this manual key generation...

Hi people, I accidentally deleted a file through git that I want to recover. But both scalpel and foremost don't seem to work with JS files.
deleted a file through git? can't you just checkout from an earlier commit?
I actually used the git reset --hard

it was. But I also force pushed it.. So it isn't online anymore. nor it's anywhere on my pc.

does anyone here use JanusVM?. does anyone here use JanusVM?. !JanusVM
things like janusvm don't make sense when you only have one uplink for example
what's an uplink?
connections to the internet
can janusvm run java programs through tor?
tor is one network you don't want to connect with
why is that?
less then 1% is legal and every security service is connected
what do you mean every security service is connected?
and as long you don't have multiple uplinks connected to true different networks and internet exchanges then it's fake security
what security services are connected
every secret service has multiple nodes running in the tor network
most nodes are in central and northern europe.  but i dont know much about this, do you know WHICH security services are connected?.  how about freenet?
I'm not going to answer for more than one reason
what reasons?
there are enough papers on why networks like tor don't work in the Internet we now live in
what about things like freenet, I2P and GNUnet
when you have at least three connections and change them every four to six months maybe, but then other people start to ask questions
do you care to elaborate in private?
when trying to mount my samba share using mount -t cifs -o guest,rw //192.168.1.197/Media /media/MINIX I get mount error(13): Permission denied on one computer while on another computer it works fine.. The difference between the two comps is one is running 13.04 (the one that fails) and the other is running 12.04. I guess I will repeat my question when trying to mount my samba share using mount -t cifs -o guest,rw //192.168.1.197/Media /media/MINIX I get mount error(13): Permission denied on one computer while on another computer it works fine. The difference between the two comps is one is running 13.04 (the one that fails) and the other is running 12.04
is this in fstab or you are manualy tring
both
are you tring to mount it from 192.768.197
no I am mounting from 192.168.1.191 
tell me : who owns /MEDIA
root. but that media is on an Android device, so don't chide me for that. lol
so why are you tring to mount the andoid dir to your ubuntu box
I have hacked the hell out of this android device and now it is a media server
why not just hook up your usb cable aand transfer files
lol.  it is not a phone
there is a samba share app in the play that will make this a lot easier for you
there is no app running this is full samba. like I said I have hacked the hell out of this android device 
so it is still running a verient of andoid
yes  but this is not relevant to my question. If you would like to read more about what I have done I can give you a link to the writeup 
ok, post it
http://minixforums.com/threads/how-to-linux-optware-ssh-samba-transmission-flexget.2825/#post-23301
i assume you can ping it correct ?
I can connect with one Ubuntu comp and not another
what about your allow and deny files in /etc
I don't understand the question
typlicly in any linux distro there is in /etc/ host.allow and host.deny files that allow or deny hosts
oh, in the hosts file. There is no whitelist or blacklist 
can you ssh to it with both ubuntu boxes
yes 
does eatch ubuntu box use the same login info
no . however they both have the same rsa pub. this shouldn't matter with samba though 
can you login to your android using the working credenials from the box with the credentials that don't work
permission denied again . if I don't provide credentials it does ask for a pw  so that is a good sign
what does your allow deny ip range look like in smb.conf. so now can you log in to android from the working ubuntu box with both sets of credentials
I don't have an allow or deny section. If you go to the github link in that link I provided you can see most of the smb.conf 
what does host allow (arround line 40).  can you pastebin your smb.conf
This is easier https://github.com/erichlf/AndroidSeedBox/blob/master/smb.conf. the only difference is the location of the share and its name 
so can you pastebin that info tem. *then.  the share should have the same location since it is on the same server. , so that is mostlikly your problem
http://pastebin.com/Pi6Gb19L. that isn't what I meant  any I pasted the actual smb.conf
can you post your entire conf i think i see a problem
that is the entire conf
do you want to allow annymouse
yes
thats a problem
ok. which setting is the problem ?
you dont need wins support , dns proxy, name resolv order or netbios name in global nor do you need guest account or preferred master. guest will never work in this there is more you need to do for it to work
ok 
so remove the guest ok, guest only entries for eadh share , and add a list of users , that will allow the user acces to the directory
I don't have guest in global . I want guest in each share though

wlan or lan

yes
is there a known bug where gvfsd is using ~ 1.7gb of memory?
I think 1.7 gb is how much ram your system has total
no.  my system has 2gb, I remember gvfsd using 1.7 gb (since my comp was acting slow, I decided to check)
your system may has 2 GB installed, but your GPU (Nvidia maybe, maybe close to a 7000M?) has some of that ram dedicated to it, so your operating system only has ~1.7GB available
right, but that doesn't explain why gvfsd is using 1.7gb of memory
If I start a new display with startx -- :1 it will be available on control+alt+F8, right?
thats how it normally works yes.
But if I run 2 GUIs at the same time, won't the programs running in those GUIs interfere with the programs in the other GUI?. I mean some programs lock files
depends on the program.
What would be an applicatoin to run 2 GUIs?
if ran by differnt users. no issues.. ran by the same issue - couldbe.. you run whatever winow manager, or desktop you want on the second x session.
Just trying to think of a scenario where it would make sens to start another display via startx -- :1
What do I do with a binary after I download it?

I can't get anything to listen to open a port to listen on; kismet UI & gpsd for example. Is there somesort of firewall by default I'm not aware of?

thanks. No rules. What could be stopping these things opening a port?

http://.rincevent.net/random/fsck.txt
Yeah. Your file system has errors. Have you run an fsck from a boot disk?
I think that's just because it's mounted.  the point is, it's very fragmented
" Yeah. Your file system has errors. Have you run an fsck from a boot disk?"
I run an fsck every 30 boots to fix things. I don't generally boot from boot disks, no
I would do that.
do you think that might help my problem? I can see it will fix the unrelated problem of having a few inconsistencies on the disk, but will it help with the fragmentation?
The other issue could be a dying hard drive.
dying hard drives can cause high fragmentation?
You won't have defrag issues. It's the file system that is corrupt.
I'm trying to get a Ralink 2860 based wireless card working under Hardy. It shows up under lspci and I've got the correct kernel module loaded, but can't seem to get NetworkManager to detect the card.. Can someone help me?

Hi , I upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 ... now Netbeans wont open :(. what can I do ?
you could try running it from a terminal and see what messages it posts
well it does opens .. but after 30 secons .. it close it self
and then post it here so we can see too.  try running "netbeans > log" from a terminal (without the ")
ok
wait until it closes and and look at the log file it created in your home dir
The program 'netbeans' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:. how do you launch it?
you will have to get the name of the executable. copy the menu entry to your desktop and look at the properties of the link

i've googled to download an oOo 3 . . but why it have "charged" ?. is it possible that oOo 3 is commercial product not like an old version of openoffice.org ?/
ooo3 is free software in both senses of the word
i've checked http://openoffice-3.org/ , why it's not to easy to download oOo 3?
there's a big "download now" button. You really should check the bug about why ooo3 is not in intrepid and see if work has been done on it in bugs.ubuntu.com though
yeah, i press "download now", there is a bored registration . .
right
why?? coz a bug ?
So nobody knows anything about causes of sound stuttering?
I had all sorts of sound problems at first. do a google search for "perfect pulseaudio setup". that fixed everything for me

how would i change it.  prefernces>network proxy is set to connect direct to internet
I'm installing a win8 usbstick installer using winusb from ubuntu repo. Why does it install grub?. On a win8 usbstick installer?
That is just a fork of the MS usb loader, basically.
Ye, so I don't understand why grub is here. Grub was not in the MS usb loader
For a boot, why does it matter?
It takes forever to install
grub just kicks to the install, has nothing to do with install time.
it said installing. then it said done, then it said installing grub. So it has been in this mode for more than 20 minutes
Not sure how this is related, but go ahead..  Installing when, what is the context?

Hi. I used to control my /ets/hosts file within NetworkManager in Hardy. Now that I've upgraded to Intrepid, I can't find the "hosts" tab. Any ideas? Thanks.

hrmm. True, you can only add stuff to localhost
proxy isn't what I'm looking for really.

hey guys. I was just in here talking about ssfs. It all worked great except that I could not write to the mounted directory. So I unmounted it and was just going to figure out what was going on. I later tried to mount it again but now I'm getting is, "fuse: bad mount point `/media/jr/pi/': Transport endpoint is not connected". I can't delete the file as root because it says I don't have permissions....so does anyone know what is going on?
sshfs?.  only gives perms to the original user, by default.  FUSE THING.  FUSE thing, even.  try fusermount -uz
what does that do?. unmount?
sometimes it will work better than -u alone
ah
though you'll still want to run it as the user it was mounted with
it worked. great! so why can't I write files to it?
how do I fix this. subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 2. ?
what are you installing?
<unconvertable>  I installed the wrong version of ubuntu-tweak and need to remove it ... but I get that error in Synaptic when i try to uninstall it
I'm not sure what to do; just try to install the correct version; think it might just overwrite the existing one.
<unconvertable>  nope ... it says that there is a more recent version already installed
Ok, this command: sudo apt-get install linux-686, what would i type for amd64 generic?
cache search doesn't show any clue of that package on that kernel. general_error: do you have a 64bit ubuntu installed?
no. so does that mean i gotta download it again?!
general_error: searches.... general_error: I believe so...64 bit kernels cannot be found in repos.... devlin: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg should do it ;)
damn ok

hey. i'd like to add some functionality to my laptop's touchpad but have no idea where to get started. any tips?
google your setup and release, or give some description of what yiou want.
12.04 LTS, when i drag something using the touchpad, it releases as soon as i let go of the touchpad. i want it to continue dragging until i tap again. it's just a free time curiosity project.
does it work on windows?. maybe the settings are different by default. like javascript stuff is disabled in ubuntu by default or something else affecting this. missing plugin. or whatnot
is there a plugin i can install from the cd?
dunno whats missing/wrong :)
I really really don't want to reinstall over grub2
seems you do not have the grub-probe program...you sure you installed grub2 properly?
grub-probe is there, i installed the grub2 from the package manager.  it gave some error saying can't configure
what error did it give you??
don't remember now. when I try aptitude install grub-pc, now, it gives this error. http://pastebin.com/5wUfieeE.  don't remember now. when I try aptitude install grub-pc, now, it gives this error http://pastebin.com/5wUfieeE
Okay, major problem, I can speedtest at 24mbps down on my windows computer ... but here on my Ubuntu laptop I get less than 1mbps?

unsure what that is
anyone got any ideas why my audio cd player won't play cds?
Is the cable connected to your cd-drive from your sound card?
xmms won't do nothing, kaffeine and amarok spin it but make no sound.  tha'ts a good question but I know it works in Windows
There's a difference between it reading the disc digitally and sending it through your computer to your sound card so to speak, and it reading it analogue and sending the sound directly to your sound card..  You might find an option in xmms to change which method it uses. Gimme a sec and I'll install xmms and check if there's such an option.
everything seems to be connected
There was a cable from your cd-rom directly to your sound card?
no there's an ide cable, a power cable and some skinny cable that goes to the mobo
the skinny cable is probably the sound cable. Is your sound cable to your speakers connected to a pci sound card or to a port in the motherboard?
I believe it goes to a pci soundcard
Which is the same card your speakers are connected to?
yes
Okay, fire up xmms please, go into options and find the audio plugins.  Audio I/O plugins to be precise.
I don't see it under the "Options" menu
Sorry.. Options->preferences
ok gotcha
now doubleclick CD Audio Player under Audio I/O plugins
CD Audio Player 1.2.10. and configure?

Are there any WEB interfaces you guys recommend for KVM?
would like to know that too
Are there any WEB interfaces you guys recommend for KVM?.  i've found this one so far: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vG0t25wZEI&feature=player_embedded
doesnt look like a web interface
there is also a webinterface
really strange that there arent a dozen open source webinterfaces out there for kvm
there are, found this list: http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Management_Tools. tell me if you find anything you like :P
yea i know that list, but most of them are either closed source or even commercial
what is this spam lol
well, 1 - my ipod doesn't unmount, nor usb pens - i just get a popup telling me there's an error. 2 - when i shutdown, it doesn't poweroff, just sits there saying "power down" after the init process is finished
have you filed a bugreport about it?
yeah, was encouraged to try dapper - which i dont really want to do
oh, sounds like its not fixed then. If they ask you to install Dapper then its probably fixed there - and will take to much effort (just guessing though) to backport to ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy). So if you dont want to try dapper - which i understand, i guess you will have to wait for Dapper...  to check if a bug is fixed - browse the buzille. The bugs will be marked as fixed when they are.. i think
so how does everyone else cope with unmounting their ipods? i cant be the only one with an ipod? :)

I'm looking for some advice on setting up a dual boot system with ubuntu. I really want to run ubuntu on a partition because I am learning to program and it seems like I should be learning linux. But I want to run windows for games and for adobe products. I have a 240GB ssd, and a 120 GB ssd... what would be a good way to partition such a system? Is this a stupid way to do it?
what's installed on what rightnow?
right now I am running lubuntu on it. but i'm about to put in the 2 new ssds
so what's the existing disk and what's the plane for that? no Windows at all right now?
yeah the existing disk is just 5400 rpm 240GB disk that i'm not going ot use anymore because the laptop can only fit 2 in it as is.
I have the most annoying network interface problem on 10.04.02 64bit which I just can't figure out. ifconfig output is good, I can ping it, but none of the services are available. it just hangs when I try to connect via ssh or http to anything but the primary IP
check the router config?
same setup works on one server, but does not work on the other one.... @ this is a server with an ISP, don't have access to the router. I did use nmap however. running it locally

If I wanted to stream HDTV to my computer how would I do it?. is there some sort of hdtv capture card?
there's a couple, but they are seriously expensive unless you are talking DVB
i have no idea what that means, I just want to learn how to turn my computer into a tivo like device so I figured the place to start is figure out how to stream a hdtv signal to it.  DVB i'm assuming is the 5-6 pin coax connection right?
What is the keyboard shortcut to navigate in Firefox3 to its home webpage?
try googling for it, just type "firefox shortcut"
Unsuitable: It returns 10400 entries.

This translates on my computers to Alt+Fn+Pos1. -- Thank you very much.

Well, the real problem is that Ubuntu can't find any wireless networks. It's a fresh install of 10.04 on a HP Pavillion dv9525
have you enabled your hardware drivers for your wifi card? i have an hp tx2500 and i had to get extra drivers for my wifi to work.
I have tethered conncetion through my phone now, but Ubuntu can't find any restricted drivers
now i get make: *** No rule to make target `install'. Stop.
did you read the readme file?
any ideas?. yes. it says to do make as user. make install as root
Can someone tell me what "Not available in the current data" means when displayed in the app store?
#ubuntu+1
huh?
the app store is available as off 9.10
yeah. So what does that mean?
if you need one for amd64, you can make one yourself
how :)?
if you still have the .bin file lying around
well. yes
ok, install the package: java-package. (if it gives an error: enable mulitverse)
syntapic ?

Linux Wireless Experts: Even though my WEP encryption is ON, Linux does not recognize that my BEFw11s4 has WEP on, does anyone know what settings I should change on the router to fix this???
you should be able to turn WEP on w/ iwconfig
I did, but when I do a "iwlist scan" I can see other routers with their setting "Encryption: on", but mine continues to say "off"
weird
tell me about it, I've been working on this for days; when I turn WEP off, it still says encryption off, but I can connect now, but I don't want to leave WEP off, you know?
Greetings. The repositories for Ubuntu is still out dated, so I'm trying to compile Bluefish myself. But it seems that I need to set an environment variable in order for the compilation to succed ($PATH). How do I set that? I have just installed gcc-4.0.

i'm having trouble installing flash on mozilla in gutsy
by mozilla, you mean something other than firefox?

upgraded to 13.04, keyboard & mouse won't respond (can't login). How to fix?
wont respond even for ctrl+alt+f1 ?
don't think so (will try soon). Num lock does not respond, so I guess not
but it's not hardware related, right?
ctrl+alt+f1 does not work. It's not hardware related but becomes a problem when ubuntu has booted up
maybe some module is missing for some very strange reason. i would investigate it via chroot environment from live. maybe i would put openssh server on that instance to get access through network after it boots up and would try to bring some logs here, lspci, lsusb, dmesg, syslog, lsmod, boot log
alright, will try. I'm trying "ubuntu with advanced option" from the boot up menu now. will try recovery mode

Can anyone answer a very simple question about the UFW firewall inherent to Ubuntu?. If you enable the UFW firewall once - do you have enable it again every time you log in?. Does anyone currently on here use the UFW firewall? I have a very simple question.
The question is hard to answer yet easy for you to figure out..  iptables (the backend to ufw) does not save changes by default but it is always on.
OK. So you are telling me the ufw firewall is on by default anyway?

hey, can someone help me with the keyring again, i have NO idea whats goin on....... I made a new keyring, and the autopassword still doesnt work
did you follow the guide I posted ?
yep, its still asking me for the password
you did really follow every step and also read the other postings from the other people in that thread?
is there anyway you can verify to see if i did it right?
nope ... but my guess is that you activated auto-login in GDM? :-)
GDM? probably not, is that my problem?
does your system ask you for username and passwd before it lets you access your desktop?
nope.  can i send you the text from the gdm /etc/pam.d file?
so you have enabled auto-login in GDM, e.g. you turn on your machine and wooosh you find yourself on your GNOME desktop?
yes
so you did not read the guide then :-)
im sending you a PM with the file info

Is there a way by which I can make every communication for each application , each port through an other computer? My isp is blocking bittorent traffic
use an SSH tunnel. Or a VPN.
I know how to ssh but how to use that for every port? how to setup this environment?
you'd use the tunnel as a local proxy.
in the bittorent client application? like ktorrent utorrent etc?
sure, why not.....  obviously, you will need to ssh to somewhere where torrents awork
are there any free such services?

testdisk is a data recovery app so isn't useful. Got muddled

what Ubuntu version? And if Unity turned on?
i have 10.10 right now
hi, is this the right place to ask support questions? i believe i just really f-ed up my install...
ask. details...
alright. running 14.04 + Win7. was building something from source, required libncurses. didn't work, so i gave up, tried to uninstall libncurses, removed wrong package, pressed enter like an idiot, and apt-get removed everything. now ubuntu doesn't even show up in grub...
not gonna ask "how" but ... WOW!
yah... i think it must've been a library that everything was dependent on. guess there wasn't a fail safe against that.... so, is there any way to salvage my install or should i just grab my files and do a fresh install?
im trying to get any sound at all. how can i determine my sound card driver so i can use it with modprobe?
sound issues, where are you at in the problem ?
im trying to get the drivers working... i think
why are you 'installing' drivers for it?
because the drivers just stopped working and seemed to have completely disappeared of their own accord
im sure, did you use alsamixer to adjust your audio ?
no audio device
so you have no audio device listed in lspci ? (please do NOT post any output from lspci in the channel --- that is more than one line)
actually my sound card is listed in lspci
ok, and when you open alsamixer, it gives an error?
yes

Hi - I'm trying to use sysctl to change some variables, but they dont seem to change. E.g sudo sysctl -w kernel.osrelease="1.2.3" does work. ANy ideas?
i would expect osrelease to be read-only
Hmm ok - what I'm ultimately trying to do is change the contents of /proc/release -- is this even possible?
/proc/release doesn't exist anymore.  maybe you meant something else (this is on 16.10)
Sorry I meant /proc/version
why do you want to change that file?
Aha - this will sound stupid, but im doing a CTF competition that involves a binary that check the value of /proc/release for a certain value. So I want to change THAT value

Would you expand VT for me?
Virtual Terminal, aka TTY (Ctrl+Alt+F1-6)
The scroll lock key doesn't work when I'm in X. Are you suggesting I should switch to a VT and try it?
I didn't think it did anything in X
It doesn't. That's the problem.
what do you expect it to do?
ogout.  Well, I've got a KVM switch that expects me to press scroll lock twice to switch between machines..  But whenever I'm in X, scroll lock seems to be disabled.
sudo dpkg --configure -a <-nm. now that i have that, anyone know what to do with the gdm.conf. anyone know what to do with the gdm.conf??????. during the upgrade to dapper
system->administration->login window
what why
thats the gui to edit gdm.conf
is there any reason to keep the current gdm rather than replacing it with the one dapper sends with the upgradE?
hello, in gedit, spell checking marks words with aprostophes as incorrectly spelled. for instance, the would "couldn't" has a red line under "couldn" how can i make gedits spellchecker aware of english contractions? i think it treats apostrophes as word bounardies
I've noticed the same thing, haven't bothered to look into it yet.
sadly, the bug has been open since 2001.  there's a working patch but i don't know why it's never been comitted
I can see it even when typing in xchat here. Words such as I've, couldn't, etc. Interestingly, haven't shows up fine since haven is a legitimate word.
it's sad that such an obvious and easybug has went uncorrected for 7 years

Rewording: My Trashcan is not displaying its items ... When I open it, Nautilus tries to show its contents indefinitely. Does anyone have any idea what happens?
open a terminal, type cd .local/share/Trash - are there any files there?
yep, there is, in all partitions :|. *there are
the trashcan is a per user thing
oh ya, I know :P I was talking about .Trash-1000 directories of other partitions that normally appears in my Trashcan. My ~/local/Trash/files have one file, and other partitions .Trash-1000 directories have many other files/dirs
then you know more than I do -- never heard of them
I'm already rebooted my system, but it still showing nothing in the Trash :|. *I
(ubuntu 15.10) When you're sharing /media dir among your home boxes, (through NFS, SSHFS or SMB), is it possible that when you plug an usb device into the server machine an app like nautilus or dolphin at the client side gets informed about it and can also mount it? (That is, getting the same behaviour as if I was sitting before the server machine)
No.
if not (and I wonder why not),  then what are the options to interact remotely with the usb device?
hi all. who may help me to configure tor and vidalia? I m not able to let them work
I could try
tnanx a lot...what should i do to let them work? i installed vidalia and tor...but im not sure bout their configuration....
Usually, there are two parts. 1) Start Vidalia. 2) Configure the applications you want to "anonymize" (Firefox for example)
vidalia onion is green, i have torbutton for firefox too but when i turn it on no page will open.  i'd like to anonymize firefox
Does it say "Timed out" or "Connection refused" or something else?
firefox now says e to add an exception.  tell me if my english is not clear...im italian =)
What address you're trying to open?
google...but the problem is with every site...my router one too
All sites ask to add an exception?
yes
Even non-SSL ones? (without https://)
may u give me an exemple?
http://www.google.com/.  That one really should _not_ ask for an exception :/
if i try to open the link u gave me it says me to add an exception =(.  may we control torbutton and vidalia parameters or something else?
Hmm, check your proxy settings -- they should look like this http://sine.cluenet.org/~/dump/firefox-socks-config.png -- except for the SOCKS port!
now if i try to open last link u gave me firefox says me connection refused by proxy server

Looks like you need to install additional development libraries.
Thanks Yaro I will look into that
Try going into Synaptic and look for libpng-dev or something tlike the same..  You're welcome.
i hate installing libs because there is always like several versions available. i ususally just get the one that looks like its the latest
That's normally good practice.
its saying that libpng-12-dev is a vertual package. that means I already have it installed basically correct?
Not sure. Is the little box next to it filled in green?
I am using apt not synaptic. but I would assume that means there is a package installed fulfilling that link
Okay, so just an easy way to see if its installed is to just sudo apt-get install libpng1.2-dev and see if it says anything about it "already being the latest version."
thats what I did. and it said 'this is a virtual package that referes to some other package. i assume the other package is installed
guys does anyone know the name of the GUI that lets you change boot order etc for dual boot in 8.10, had it instaled once and forgot what it was called
it's really simple to do without a GUI you know...
orly?
edit /boot/grub/menu.lst , the boot options are at the bottom of the file, you just cut and paste them to different positions. if you have any that you don't want you can comment them out aswell with a #
thank you mate, will try it :)
make a copy of the file in case anything goes wrong
lol yeah i learned that much already :p
when i use "nmcli connection edit" to create/edit a connection i get the following error when i try to save "Error: connection verification failed: 802-1x.eap: property is missing". But i dont want to use EAP on the connection how can i disable or set the option to off? it only happens if i view the 802-x1 settings with the command "goto 802-1x". I am trying to understand why this behaviour happens and. what i am doing wrong
do you run ubuntu or debian? since you asked on both channels.
ubuntu 17-10
then you should not have asked in #debian
i also asked in #gnome as well? isnt ubuntu a debain derivative and also nmcli is a gnome tool right, what is wrong with this behavour?
ubuntu is a debian derivative, but they're not the same (actually pretty different nowadays). if you're looking for help with your distribution you should ask in your distro's support channel (only).
ok thanks for the clarity.  do you also get the same error? do you know how to fix the error

Hi. Major problem here - I had evolution open and my laptop ran out of battery. When I hooked it up to power, all my e-mail is gone (it asked me to create a new account). Does anyone know how I might extract an (important!) attachment from the lost e-mail? Thanks
Wouldn't such a file also be stored on the server end?
No :(
I would guess that Evolution has a backup dir for such things...I just have no idea where it is.
Hehe I was hoping so too;)
so assuming I want to develope on it where do i get necessary packages to install
synaptic......apt-get
pls  dont get what is synaptics
hi guys. I use gnome 3 on ubuntu 12.04. when i install plugin under gimp the window is going outside the desktop. just don know how to fix it. please see the upload of the screen shot to see how it looks. http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2yvuwzt&s=6. thanks in advance
on unity you can grab with the pushed alt-key and push it upwards
is there any fix on gnome 3?
sry, dont know
on unity, can u explain me how exactly should i be doing that. press alt key and then resize it, is that the way?
A slight annoyance with Ubuntu 11.04 - the main, smaller monitor horizontal has out of bounds the height of the secondary, bigger monitor

How come I can't change default application for different filetypes in gnome? I tried Properties/Open With, but I can't check any of the other programs in the list, nothing happends
be sure to click on the bullet, not on the name
- I've done that, nothing happends.  - it selects the program, but the radiobox remains unchecked
While creating LiveISO or LiveUSB, how is swap size decided? Or is it required?. I don't have to worry about it as the application/command will write the image but does swap comes anywhere in the process?
on a live usb, the system will use any swap space available on the file system, if there is none, it won't use any. No swap space is usually created on the live usb itself
System will use any space available on the fc created on usb?. fs
on the whole file system actually. If you have a swap partition on your hard drive it will be used
What in cases where linux is installed on usb?
i believe thats what i use. it says that when i boot
in Nautilus, you just right-click on a file, then select "Open with other application"
oh, okay. will it set it as the default then?
then you choose the program from the list, or if it isn't in the list, type in the name in the bottom. there should be a checkbox for "always use this type" or something at the bottom
oh, okay. thanks a ton 
so, how is it possible that direct rendering isn't working even though compiz is running?

So, I'm having a bit of an issue. I'm creating a Truecrypt 7.1 volume and right when the volume is finished encrypting, I get a popup which reads, "Administrator privileges required: Enter your user password or administrator password:". I've tried entering both my user and root password, but neither work. Is there some password I should be entering here that I'm forgetting?
have you tried using truecrypt with sudo?
I'm pretty new, I'm not using it through the terminal or anything. How would I do that?
in a terminal: sudo truecrypt.  : in a terminal: sudo truecrypt.  just out of interest, you do know that truecrypt is no longer under development? there have been some security concerns in the past, but you should still be able to use the software..  there's a rebuild of truecrypt called realcrypt, but it's only in an RPM build. alien should convert to a .deb file just fine and realcrypt behaves just like truecrypt and is currently maintained.
Yes, I am aware of that. All security concerns are really just based on the warning on the website - it is still one of the most (if not the most) tried and tested encryption tools in existence. TC 7.1a passed a fairly extensive audit and I trust TC 7.1a more than I trust any new ones which have recently came out. Yes, I've heard of realcrypt. I feel more comfortable right now using something with a more extensive history.. Also, thanks - I think your suggestion is going to work.
is there a text based install for the kubuntu 7.04 cd?

unfortunately, i think we're stuck with sloppy focus from here on out. you can play around with the configuration resource editor, and set the mouse focus setting there, but i believe strict follow is no longer an option..  (I miss it, too :-)
thank you :-)

Okay so Im having a bit of a problem. I have Ubuntu installed on my Dell Inspiron Duo and everything was working fine, after a reboot my wireless networking suddenly no longer works
are you fuly updated?
Yes its fully updated to the latest version of 11.04
ok can you run: sudo lshw -C network; lsb_release -a; sudo rfkill list use http://pastie.org to host the text. Chris3: as long as the files are healthy, you will be ok
I run all those things at the same time?
yes, its a single command
Should it be taking a minute.  Nvm its done
the lshw will take a while
Lol just realised, I cant pastie it with no internet
is the system a laptop?

Dell Inspiron Duo... it does not have an ethernet port
hey guys, I want to use ssh from my ubuntu machine to access my remote server, where would I put the ssh key file? (I don't have keyboard interactive login enabled, I just use a SSH key)
you're asking where you would put it on the server?
- no where I would put it on my laptop... I'm kinda used to windows/putty. where you have a file stored locally. and then something on the server-side as well.. Wondering if it's the same on ubuntu
the ssh client looks at ~/.ssh/id_rsa by default. But you can configure more with ~/.ssh/config
Okay. thanks :D
How can I set the default audio device by hardware id?. er device # from aplay -l
then, you can stop troubleshooting the connection
no, it seems it only works w/ aplay, i cant get pulse audio to set it to the right hdmi :(
*nothing* using pulse has used it?
Nope
still, i think its likely you have routing issues
aplay -D plughw:0,3 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav works
i would double double check in pavulcontrol
i set it to all the different hdmi options in pavulcontrol and no audio

no. or not that i know off

I had an issue running external commands on Nagios3 in Ubuntu 10.04. I googled the error, found an answer that fixed it. It had my type in g-statoverride --update --add nagios www-data 2710 /var/lib/nagios3/rw sudo dpkg-statoverride --update --add nagios nagios 751 /var/lib/nagios3 and restart nagios. That worked, but I don't know why, could anyone explain what these commands did?. Oops, I pasted that wrong, the commands were sudo dpkg-statoverride --update --add nagios www-data 2710 /var/lib/nagios3/rw. sudo dpkg-statoverride --update --add nagios nagios 751 /var/lib/nagios3. Any ideas on what these did?
It changed the owner of that file in a friendly way so that if nagios gets updated and this file gets touched by the package again, it won't reset to the original permissions.
ah ok, thanks, also, what were those numbers I put in as well? the 2710 and 751

the LTS to LTS upgrade is opened when 14.04 will become 14.04.1
Thanks! In this case, do you think I should just wait for 14.04.1?
yes. if you use a LTS you want 14.04 to settle first
Gotcha. Thanks!
what's the difference between "make" and "make fprofiled"?

does it have root access?
no, but now I see why it wasnt loading them *facepalm* thanks
silly mistakes are easy :P glad I could help
wait, still nothin
anything happen when you type in a terminal sudo gedit /etc/passwd?. obviously don't edit the file, of course
you could say that

Hey everyone. I am back with a brand new install of lubuntu 12.04 and testing it out. Do we have a separate channel for it or shoudl I ask the general questions here. For one I want to get an easier way of arranging launchers and icons on a panel as was in gnome. and second I need a way to get the keybindings working. any suggestions anyone ?
theres #lubuntu ..there are only these http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Main_Menu

i really want to know why when i type sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg it doesnt bring up the thiing to configure.. it just generatates a really basic xorg.conf and quits, doesnt ask me to edit anything like screen rez or driver or whatever.
ok..so the only option is to add modelines into the xorg.conf and to do that you need to do man xorg.conf.  it'll help you how to edit the file
i have some experience with xorg.conf but everything is so confusing because i cant input the right values for monitor and for video card and stuff because linux is running under virtual machine.

With which command can I change the keymap used by X11? (e.g. do the same as in System -> Preferences -> Keyboard by changing the order of the entries of "Selected layouts")
setxkbmap
Where does setxkbmap look? I successfully changed it to the built-in de (with "setxkbmap de"), but when I want to change it to a custom layout, how do I do that? (it's already selectable in the "Keyboard Preferences", e.g. it has an entry in evdev.xml)
if you need to change the layout to something really custom, you can try xmodmap tool (man xmodmap for details), but if you need just different variant of de (like dvorak) issue setxkbmap de -variant dvorak . In both cases consult man setxkbmap first :)
I customized the "de" keymap (i.e. I created a new file in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ and added it to /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml ). I just need to know how I can select it with setxkbmap.
my knowledge is not so far

where did you mount it to?
I just stuck a CD in my drive
ah. Is there not a cd icon on your desktop?
yes
click on it.
it opens it in sound juicer... but it is a media/data CD and I want the data.  I thought it would mount on media/cdrom but nothing is there
ah. Try right-lciking, see if there are any options. Otherwise, load up the file manager and navigate to /media/cdrom0
no options other than the cd juicer, and there is nothing in cdrom0 or cdrom... which doesn't seem possible because I have already taken the music from it just now successfully.

does anyone know of a guide to configure NTP authentication between ubuntu and cisco routers/switches?
should just be flat config files.  it depends on the auth method the cisco devices are using
md5
md5 isn't an authentaction method
I'm pretty sure Cisco devices use MD5 as the authentication method...
that's an encyption cipher, not an authentication method
ok, w/e... I'm just trying to set up authenticated NTP between my ubuntu server and my cisco lab

any samba guru's here?
what do you need?
howdy... Trying to get the windows machine to see my linux server as smb. I can do NFS, but the windows machine won't see it...
samba is installed?
yessir. errr well I think. heh
there's a config file in etc, look at it and its man page (some server'ish stuff is disabled by default)
smbcacls smbcquotas smbpasswd smbtar
so, not samba?
all that swtuff is installed and there is /etc/init.d/samba.  I'm a dork
:p
I figured samba was there wita ll that stuff err with all that stuff there
quite a few apps can do stuff with samba, so they'll use the same libs without actually installing the samba server stuff. !easyubuntu
odd, I thought smb came with Dapper by default.
hey, was wondering, i recently recorded a video podcast using the cheese software and was wondering how i might be able to encode it or save it as a mp4 or ogg file instead of the proprietary weird file format?. also, I noticed that i can change gstreamer-properties but wasn't sure how actually to go about that.... is that a terminal command that i need to use?. or is that something in my general settings stuff that i can find?. right now, its (cheese) is saving the video as a webm file.. i would need to save it as a more common video file, such as mp4 or avi even....
mencoder or ffmpeg can convert files
it will be able to convert cheese's own webm file format to something more common?
yes
how do i change gstreamer-properties?
not played with t, sorry
is that a terminal command thing?

can you dump me contents of /var/log/Xorg.0.log?. in the same paste

you are using some PPA with newest Xorg and support for amdgpu-pro, I assume? Well, AFAIK amdgpu-pro is not supported on anything lower than RadeonSI (7xxx). But the possible reason of why no driver at all is loaded could be different - like you didn't update initramfs or didn't install newer kernel required for the library..  looking up.  yeah, you are trying amdgpu-pro with old kernel 4.4
so what should I do now?
this line "[ 29.562] (II) [KMS] drm report modesetting isn't supported.".  two things - you can either remove the PPA and get back to original state, or you can install kernel - but you need said hardware support for amdgpu-pro. AFAIK its currently even only available for rx 4xx, with planned expansion towards 7xxx..  so if you go path 2, then you will end up with newer "radeon" driver.
Would you please help me out what ever you think is better for me
I have stock HWE 4.8 kernel here (16.04 LTS) and xenial backports activated. Works for my r9.
because I really don't what to do now. https://ghostbin.com/paste/984xp
short version - we can either unroll the changes(1) or finish the changes(2), however that amdgpu-pro driver supports only hardware rx 4xx. It will not support 5xxx, you will be using NEWER stack.. you will be using NEWER "radeon" driver on your hardware, not "amdgpu-pro".
SO it's up to you final decision
I would roll back the changes, unless you want to experiment..  can you please give me output of this: "grep ^ /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*"
we can remove the amdgpu-pro and installing the suitable driver?
basically this.  even if you install required Kernel for amdgpu, the amdgpupro will NOT run on your hardware..  "radeon" driver will, its newer version.

is the kernel disregarded when you upgrade with synaptic by default?
- what do you mean "dis-regarded"
well, some distro's let you upgrade the system without updating the kernel
Hi, is there a way of determining which drivers are currently in use? I'm trying to diagnose a problem with my ATI Gfx card and want to know what is and isn't in use and what's installed...

thanks - I tried that but wondered whether there was more detail available - hence query
PLEASE HELP!!! I cannot boot into Breezy!!! Root file check constantlly fails on bootup and I don't know what to do. PLEASE HELP!!!
does it give you a root prompt after failing the root fs check?
yes. something like root@(none)~#: or something like it....  root@(none):~#
at that prompt, run 'fsck' with your root fs partition (something like /dev/hda1) and answer 'y' to everything
even Y to abort?
at least, every time it asks if you want to fix something
ok but last I remember from the 50+ times I never realy got asked to fix anything :(. I'll try your method
Can anyone tell me how to launch eclipse after installing the package?
opne up a console and type eclipse

Nothing there
then you don't have the binary then
So the package is worthless then?

why ssh service starts during booting? I checked with sysv-rc-conf, it is not enabled. Why?
Checked /etc/init/ssh.conf ?
oh I see.  How to disable it?
Comment out the 'start on' section.
so Ubuntu does not honor sysv runlevel system, I should not count on what I see in sysv-rc-conf, right?
Ubuntu uses upstart, but I believe it still uses runlevels.
Is there a tool for /etc/init like sysv-rc-conf for /etc/init.d?.  how can I know what services is enabled and what is not?
initctl list ?
How can I configure what services to start ?
sudo service <name> start ?
How can I choose what services to start during booting?. like sysv-rc-conf, or ntsysv in redhat systems
so, I've dd'd /dev/sda with zeroes, so can anyone please explain why these /dev/sda?_crypt still exist? http://imgur.com/hqrOasv

And you booted a live cd, for running that command?
I did it inside the 14.04 netinstaller (switched to another tty)
hi there. i just installed another distro on another partition, but now my grub is all messed up. i can't load ubuntu anymore. how do you fix your grub loader up?
sorry to hear that, but it is easy to fix
good good!
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351.  just instead of "find /boot/grub/stage1", you do "find /boot/grub/menu.lst".  the rest of the steps remain same.
im currently on gentoo. will these instructions work for it?
it will work on gentoo also yes

is it best to do this from a livecd, as my reading seems to indicate, i merely ask for a second opinion
Hey, does anyone know much about displays? In particular hooking up nvidia cards to a TV?
decent screens repot edid when the video card asks for it.
Sorry? I don't understand
there is a technology called EDID that tells systems what resolutions and refresh rates are possible. Cheap screens dont do thisand require manual settings by the user.  some users find they need to make an xorg.conf to tell the system how to work rather than the hardware working it out

Hello, I just installed Hardy, and left old Win XP with dual-boot. Although boot is fine, I cannot see Win partition. Can anyone help me?!?
neocortex: you mean you can boot in to windows but you cannot see the partition in ubuntu?
Yes, exactly
what kind of hard drive is windows on? ide or sata?
sata
you could try fdisk -l in the terminal and see if you can see it there
sata, but my friend changed that in bios, I think. Nevertheless, it was fine in Gutsy.  Yes, I can see it
i think you need to mount it but im too nooby to know how
I tried that, but answer was that it is busy
did you shut down windows properly or did you just power it off?
DiCahill: I did proper shutdown.  I did proper shutdown
then i'm not sure what to suggest.  im on the livecd at the moment and i can't get any output at all from fdisk -l
Interestingly enough, I did live before install, and then I could see my win partition.

I was attempting to create the 'wheel' access group so only people in the wheel group have access to su and sudo. I added the group wheel (using groupadd), added myself (local user) and root to the group and then chowned /bin/su and /bin/sudo to wheel group. Su and Sudo are not working.. For example, "Failed to run /usr/sbin/synaptic as user root. **** Received: Unable to run /bin/su: Permission denied" .. Obviously that is a GUI error by way of GKSU.. But the same goes for terminals.
sudo -i fails?
That's the other fun part about it. I never changed root's password. It is claiming the password is wrong via sudo - i.. And su obviously is "bash: /bin/su: Permission denied."

that's a real-time kernel?
yes.  yes it is. rt on hardy worked with fglrx.
hmmm, i don't know much about real-time kernels. i don't know.  what version of the fglrx driver?
what would you do on a normal kernel?.  I dont know. I have tried to install whatever is in the Ibex repo.
i don't think there is an fglrx driver in the Ibex repo... unless they recently added it, because ati only recently cam out with an fgrlx driver that works with kernel 2.6.27. s/cam/came

that's it? i just move it and it will be auto regened? even with a binary driver selected?.  someone else told me sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
if one doesn't exist one will be created; on versions befor 9.10
i have 9.10
that too would create a new one but why get rid of the old one without making a back up.
thanks!
since you're on 9.10 you will not get a new xorg.conf but things will be auto detected.
one more thing.. how do i restart x? i can delete the file (i already backed it up before).  so i SHOULDNT RM my xorg.conf?
make backups rather than deleting. much safer.. sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart .will restart X ..if you're using gnome.  sudo service gdm restart is the preferred method on 9.10 and beyond.
thanks but you did not answer my question. i already did make backups.. but you say things will be autodetected but it won't create a new xorg.conf?

Can anyone recommend me a stable working Gpart for my USB?. All the gparts keep freezing or staying stuck on a black screen
what have you used so far?
Hold on let me check the history clicks. i went here and tried three different gparts. http://gparted.org/download.php. i486.iso. i686
start from the beginning, what brings you here, what are you trying to do
i am trying to edit the partition to get rid of ubuntu. I know there are other ways like wipe clean ur hd using the terminal. but that takes time
boot from the live cd or usb, then use gparted to erase the partition
I did, im using a usb, tried two different unetbootins and pendrive usb installer. everytime i go to the boot screen i either get stuck on the menu frozen
how did you install ubuntu the first time?
or with other gparts i experienced black screens. I used a usb to install ubuntu. side by windows 7
boot from the medium you used the first time
Im using the same USB, but... I remember using a Gpart that worked and the gui looked different, I cannot seem to find that specific type
are you in a live session now? if yes, use gparted
u mean like apt-get gpart?
no, in the menu, choose gparted.  are you now in ubuntu?
yes i am in ubuntu
and did you install it inside windows (wubi) ?
no, I did not use wubi. It has its own partition
then why don't you simply boot into a live session? what goes wrong?
I get to choose to use either windows 7 or ubuntu. Live session?
yes, the live dvd or usb.  what you used to install ubuntu
yea I used an ubuntu.iso type of file that converted to usb
preferably not squid
are you part of the sky army?
no?.  what is that?

you can get the old file from your backup. If you don'y have a backup, it is gone
but i didn't created any backup and that was my /etc/hosts file
Well, you'll need to recreate it
but there was too many contents in it and i really don't remember all of them
never run a sudo command unless you know what it does, and back up _everything_
that means it is gone no solution for that?. any cache or somethin?. *something
no perfect solution. You can run the "mount" command to see what is mounted just now, and work out how to recreate your fstab
i run the mount command but not understanding what it is returning can you please guide me a little bit?
run "mount | nc termbin.com 9999" and post the URL here

what's that mean?
run "sudo blkid" and you'll see the UUIDs of your partitions
yea i can see them
change the "/dev/sd?" bits with "UUID=whateverthebigstreamoflettersis" without the quotes.  that'll make things more robust if you add extra disks to the system
i can't do that.  can you please tell me how can i write a string from shell into etc/hosts?.  i am trying to use sudo echo "hello" > /etc/hosts.  but getting error permission denied
aargh. Sorry - I misread your earlier post as /etc/fstab rather than /etc/hosts... :(.  what is in your /etc/hosts just now?.  the preferred way to _append_ to a system file is with "echo whatever | sudo tee -a /path/to/file". Note the "-a" flag which appends rather than replaces
thanks man you saved me :)
sorry about the misreading on my part. Now, I can give you a basic /etc/hosts file if you need it?
i haven't tried the recory part yet just created a new /etc/hosts file :)
ignore all that filesystem stuff I was talking about above. I had gone off on the wrong tangent
i am working at my office and we have another systems so i just copied that file from another one :).  ok no probs
ha! good stuff
:).  and one alternate for writing sudo -- sh -c "echo test >> /etc/hosts".  what is good in between of them?
when does it get loaded? ^_^
hm, nope, there's more than that. it actually installs [part of] itself there (though it should already be installed since you copied it, but anyway it won't hurt for sure)
('cause it should load *before* using /dev/mapper/nvidia_ifififi
i really don't know a thing about any flavor of RAID, sorry...
okay, thanks anyway :)
aight ... i'm kind of stuck on this one ... my pc restarts when i try to install from the live cd before it even gets fully booted ... and the alternate just reboots halfway through the installation ..
Maybe try some boot parameters like noacpi noapic
will try now
it might also help if you get rid of the quiet parameter there, then you see better what's going on...
removed both splash and quiet yes.  i'm going to assume that a list of buffer i/o error on device fd0 etc isn't supposed to be there right?
Do you have a floppy at all?
nope.  wait ...
then I would tend to ignore it...
darn ... :( still reboot ... just when it was supposed to launch x
Try the alternate boot cd with noapic and noacpi....  maybe it's todo with the GraphicsCard
i'm almost certain it does ... but it runs fine with windows ... even with vista ....  the alternate one dies just after configuring the resolutions for x
I just installed Ubuntu on an old PC and I looked at the partitions, and it has the Extended partition (which contains the same-sized ext4 partition) and the Swap partition, but on my other installation of linux, the swap is under the extended partition along with ext4; did I do it wrong?
this should not matter at all
Ok
Hi guys, I have a HDD where write speed for ex4 is considerable slower than for ext2, i.e. for ext4 I get 14-15MB/s where for ext2 I get 60-70MB/s.. any help?
is it a spinning disk, or sold-state?.  remember that ext3/4 use a journal log for updates, which would have some impact, but not to the degree you've described
it is a spinning drive, HGST Travelstar 7K1000
so not a TRIM issue then.  how is the disk connected to the PC? SATA? USB? something else?
SATA
the only thing I can think of is that the writes to the ext4 are small random writes, requiring lots of head seeking
it is a dd if=/dev/zero ... conv=fdatasync.  full command - dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/sda1/test2 bs=1M count=100 conv=fdatasync
hmmm, I'm not sure then. ext4 has a reputation for being very fast, generally
it is the same with ext3 and vfat, I tested it.  only ext2 seems to be fast there
Is /etc/init.d/mysql called something else in 8.04?
its called mysqld.  hmm or not.  ls -l /etc/init.d/ and you can see what is in there
Yes, I know, but there is no files starting with "mysql..."

I'm having a strange problem. I upgraded to 7.10 and now certain network and external device related tasks are so slow they crash gnome. The things I've noticed are super slow ssh authentication (but terminal is fine once connected), browsing a samba share is so slow it hangs gnome, browsing my USB MP3 player is very slow as well. Has anyone seen anything like this before?. All of these things were very fast before the upgrade.
don't dist-upgrade....put home folders on sepearate partition and system on another then fresh install over sysmte partition
hindsight is 20/20, but I'm upgraded now,

Hi there. I just did two things: 1) Got a new ISP 2) Got the new version of ubuntu. And now for some reason every dns request to a google domain redirects to microsoft.com. I'm about two seconds from calling my ISP and yelling at them. but the way it is behaving reminds me a lot of the way dns-controlling virii work on windows (it appears to be restricting my search queries). So I was wondering if there were any known virii that are in the wild in ubuntu that have that behavior
Stevo!
yes, ?
Any ideas on where to start troubleshooting why my system will entirely freeze (except the mouse) about once a week?. I'm a semi-n00b
when it happens, looking at the logs would be a starting point
not seeing anythign in the logs that lloks unusual so far, but dont' know exactly which to concentrate on, and don't necessarily know what is "good" or "bad" when I look at it.
first thing i thought when i read the question was a big cronjob, like a backup job or something, just a thought. but that would be repeating on a very stable pattern i suppose, it's not every week? :)
no, it's not consistent; have had it happen twice in one day, but that was about a month ago. Just happenend about 10 minutes agao.
New Ubuntu user here, I am having two issues that I could use some help with. 1 is my headphone jack isnt working. 2 is a dual boot question where windows wont open. Any one have any suggestions?
1.) Not working means you have no sound or sound is still coming through the speakers? 2.) What exactly does "windows wont open" mean? Is it not booting at all or is it booting and then crashing?
@vamp898 1) the speakers work but using the headphone jack does nothing, I am unaware of a way to test different ways to make it work. 2) After installing Ubuntu I can not load windows from the dual boot screen. When selected that way the screen takes on the default ubuntu screen color and sits there indefinitely. I can go into the BIOS and load into windows though. Its EFI if thats pertinent
but when you plugin the headphone jack, there is no more sound on the speakers, right?
vamp898: there is still sound coming threw the speakers
That doesnt sound good (i mean, maybe it does, maybe those are good speakers, but i mean more like your problem :D)
haha. yeah!
knock knock anybody is there???

Ubuntu FROZE. again. While repeating a sound. I was in Firefox at the Jon Stewart site. Went into a sound loop repeating the same sound and froze. (In past had freezing trouble. took CD out as advised and no problems for a week since.) System is: Ubuntu 9.10 on AMD 32bit, only ubuntu no windows at all. FYI, one other chronic issue that chrome goes on audio strike from time to time. Still no CD in drive.. can you help?. windows: you want to use your webcam. you need to run Photoshop. That's 2.
both work in ubuntu. photoshop only up to CS2
really, I have photoshop elements can I make that work? And how do I call anyone on ekiga? they all use skype.. <-- eager to learn

My keyboard has suddenly just stopped working. Whats wrong?. Im on a different computer. I cant even login. I had just installed new themes. And I started using a new one. Then around 10 mins later. My keyboard just stopped

Hi, how can I check how much memory is available on my live USB if I am running ubuntu from the live USB drive?
You mean how much drive space?
How much "free" drive space
df -h
If I created the live USB while allocating the rest of the entire memory to store system settings, would "df -h" say that my drive is full? I used the System->Administration->create a USB startup disk application to make my life USB
tokenekie, df -h shows ALL mounted drives, total space, free space, used space. That's all it does..  just type it and see, you'll understand.
Yeah, but it says my 1.9g live USB drive is completely full, which I dont believe. Unless it actually is full
Can you do a head -100 tmpodbUant8Y0N81fFBnaffTyBUwyJf9VeZTCkBgiy9DNIXlZrTEKvUZ8sRt_oGUuveMJ1HAbBZcC_ip1loRgY9PaA6qcd2rXhC6fSif6.kBo3UDFlPwSPJLD8Ta9fVDO4dL9-1_tPDcv2O1zml7iMmhju\ z9chywpHF_1PNc\ ZkXTqTK8nzou58\ ZPG40xrPBbe6U08dsP77BOZomuCuHONW_a9ghFBXknqsl1Y7BbuWpGO8_xrInaFkxvjzN. It extracts the first 100 bytes out of the file. If it is a common file, it will have a magic. head -c 100*. Yes. Da fuck?. Another thing we can try. od -t x1 -N 100 tmpodbUant8Y0N81fFBnaffTyBUwyJf9VeZTCkBgiy9DNIXlZrTEKvUZ8sRt_oGUuveMJ1HAbBZcC_ip1loRgY9PaA6qcd2rXhC6fSif6.kBo3UDFlPwSPJLD8Ta9fVDO4dL9-1_tPDcv2O1zml7iMmhju\ z9chywpHF_1PNc\ ZkXTqTK8nzou58\ ZPG40xrPBbe6U08dsP77BOZomuCuHONW_a9ghFBXknqsl1Y7BbuWpGO8_xrInaFkxvjzN. Will print it in hexadecimal.
lots of 0s
Figured. Who's the owner of the file?
me. it seemed to appear after I used bleachbit
Always a bad idea
could be related to this http://askubuntu.com/questions/427647/strange-folder-in-my-home-folder-after-a-failed-run-of-bleachbit
lol.  I'd just delete it. Can't be something important. If it starts with 0 bytes
will do. another thing. possible OT, but how do I post install windows 7?
You mean after you installed Ubuntu?
yep yep
You kinda did the wrong way around :p. Since, whenever you install Windows 7 now, grub will be affected
can't I reinstall grub? supergrubdisk used to do that automatically
So, how this works. Run gparted. Create your windows partition.. Install Windows 7. Use your live USB to install grub again. And it will fix it
is there a way to verify the integrity of my linux install? or if i accidentally delete a file, a way to replace it?
backups
so no way to verify then?
dont think so, if it is so, you dont need backups..
it makes sense to back up my data, but not to back up various OS files
is there a channel for driver support ?
what device, the drivers are "the kernel"
i mean like for vdeo cards
I've just installed Transmission on my server, but for reason I can't seem to get it configured correctly and I can't find any logs or any errors otherwise indicated.. On the remote client on my android, I'm getting the error "Connection Refused"
@clueless last time i got connection refused it had something to do with the port being closed
The port is most definitely open.  I was just running deluge on that port, I uninstalled deluge, installed transmission, configured it for the same port. and I double checked the software firewall..  However according to my port scan, my server isn't responding on port 9002.  What should the rpc bind address be?.  I have the whitelist as false, rpc bind address 0.0.0.0 rpc port as what I need.
hmm tbh i have no idea :(
Could I see a copy of your configuration file?.  ?
swappiness is a nice tweak also
: what you put your swappiness as?. i played with it and made ff crash... heh

I understand that Pulseaudio is available for WIN32. Is it possible, then, to stream audio over a network from a soundcard-less WIN32 box to a Ubuntu box with a soundcard?
last time i check the windows pulseaudio was incomplete and still did not have suport to steam over network... and the source machine has to have a soundcard but can be one not conected to speakers...
Ah, good to know. Yeah I knew it was possible between Linux hosts, but I didn't want to go on a wild goose chase trying to do it with Windows if it wasn't possible.. thanks
Has anyone got wireless to work with a broadcom 43224 chip?
I know i got my wireless working with BCM4401 .
what driver did you use?
also here no harddisk ninjas around? :(
i'd try running all the repair utilities that you know of first. and if that doesnt work, you'll need to do advanced things like dumping the data out and trying to reconstruct files. thats advanced and tedious though :P
well, that's what i did
you have a raw dump of the disk then?.  the real problem is if your inode structure is destroyed, you need some tricky hacks to find out how exactly each file is scattered across the disk. and the system tools are best for that, their written by the ext designers, who know the ins-and-outs
well, badblocks did show up a couple of bad inodes
hello! for Xubuntu - for an older dell laptop, do I want the desktop or the alternate release (lucid longterm)

anyone know a command line tool to rip main movie froma dvd to avi?

Will hunt around in there, thanks. (:

updated to 16.04, result: hostapd now says that ht capab [SMPS-STATIC] is no longer supported, iw is showing it, was working previously, maybe someone knows when exactly it happened because i believe i'm not the only one with such thingy
see this, not sure if it helps ... https://github.com/wifiphisher/wifiphisher/issues/219
o/  thx. nah,  unfortunately hostapd -d explicitly states that it fails at this certain capab, removing it from old previously working config makes things spin heh. but thanks
the hostapd config file should list the HT_capab and it could be an issue, see ... http://forum.ipfire.org/viewtopic.php?t=14513
this certain line used to work with ralink on pci bus since idk 12.04 probably (can't remember well) until 16.04 "ht_capab=[SMPS-STATIC][GF][SHORT-GI-20][SHORT-GI-40][HT40-][HT40+][RX-STBC12][TX-STBC1]". after proceeding to 16.04 it is enough to remove [SMPS-STATIC] from it to make it work, i wonder what is the reason for it, since iw lists it
fsck on a 70GB lvm partition takes hours and failed with "out of memory - killed". Any idea?
what fiel system is on it ?
ext4
stupid quetion, but is there a problem on it to make you want to fsck it ?
Got some processes going into D, rebootet the server, and trying to do a fsck. Might have been some latency to SAN causing the state D
going into D ?
uninterruptible sleep
I'd be very concerned if your san had that much latency fsck was timing out
fsck is not timing out, but seems to be "find / |xargs rm" was the first process going into uninterruptible sleep

Ok my issue is that the support for the ia32-libs multi-aarch is broken in Ubuntu12.10.. I mean it gives.. "no such file or directory" when trying to run the prebuilt gcc on 64-bit Ubunutu. which usually means missing 32-bit libraries..
did you install the 32-bit libraries?.  ia32-libs doesn't exist anymore
yes...  but I just installed..:0.  am a newbie to this development porcess though..:)
aww man. this program is awesome. oh dear, looks like its gonna crash
hrm. Looks more-or-less ok to me.

could you please also put /var/log/Xorg.0.log on the paste-bin ?
hang on. its crashing
explore2fs ?
yupz
it can break on big files, as i said
damn
the version i used seemed to copy the whole file into main memory (!) before writing it to disk
wad version was that 
dunno. i'm not on windows, so i can't check ;)

Backports enabled.  ???
I totally missed what you said
Backports enabled
are you asking if they should be, shouldn't be, are, aren't what?
I mean, i have latest version on repos
ok, try killall gnome-panel and see if it works on reload.
Nope
thats really strange.
Weird, in my mom's account it works fine
usually its not one applet that gives problems but the whole panel or nothing,
Should i remove it and put it again?

my usb device doesn't get detected if connected through two usb hubs. can anyone help? lsusb doesn't show anything even though it was detected before (through two hubs).
do these usb hubs have their own power adapters?
no, but the power drawn through the port shouldn't exceed 500mA. so lack if power isn't it...
if you draw 500mA through two unpowered hubs, i'm pretty sure you are exceeding the power budget.  anyway, USB only allows for one consecutive level of unpowered hubs.
really! thanks :) that's what i've been doing wrong then...

can anyone tell me if ubuntu comes with an archive tool that can handle .rar files, and if so what it's called?
install package unrar-nonfree
fujitsu: thanks.  does that install libs for KDE Archive manager, or is it it's own thing?
It should work with both Ark and it's own thing, I think, .
got it, thanks a lot :)
Yo!. There we go. Got warty up and going on my thinkpad :). Had to swap out wireless cards, couldn't get my new one to work, installing ndiswrapper is too much for me LOL

This is an i1200 from the end of 2001, I couldn't get dapper or breezy to even load. It would freeze up at the hardware and cd-rom detect thing at 86%.  I read a bunch of things on the forums, yet nothing was able to get me past it
warty freezes up on this one when its checking apt sources
although warty installed just fine so who knows lol
how can i make a terminal command be automatically executed every time i start the computer?
Do you want it to be run when you start the computer OR when you log in?.  Usually people actually mean the latter.
well, the thing is, i don't need to repeat the command after i log out and log in but only after i shut down and start new.  you still there?
when i ssh from box 1 to box 2 i get the "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! " how do i delete the finerprint of that host from my '~/.ssh/known_hosts
use ssh-keygen -R
using the RSA key?
no, the host name
ok i had to reinstall OS, and thats why i am getting this error, do i put the old host name or the new one?
i've deleted 2 default third party repositories, how do i take them back ?
re add them gpl. same way you put them there the first time
idk what were they, but i know, they were the default ones
Hi all, I am getting a error: couldn't call CWAP(1) when booting into a clean install of ubuntu 10.10 on a USB drive (booting via grub4dos and then plop), the system continues to boot after this and gets to the login screen, but when i login it freezes/hangs at the end of the login drum sound. I have tried editing the grub switches acpi=off and apm=off with no luck.. I'm running an asus M6Ne laptop
try typinghelp at the prompt and hit enter twice
which prompt are we talking about here?
when it starts to boot 
and what am I trying to achieve by doing that?.  ?
yo
what am i trying achieve here.... at this stage when I boot (I assume because I"m using grub4dos) I get to the grub menu for ubuntu - I have a bunch of options, including boot to restore mode or boot normally. I have already booted to restore mode and tried fixing broken packages to no avail. but I'm not getting to a command line at any point
not sure walked into this convo > shoulda kept my muzzle closed but what are you trying to do ?
trying to get a fresh install of 10.10 to boot without freezing on my asus m6ne laptop
ok so u have a iso and trying to install ubuntu from that booting the usb ?
Have an iso, have downloaded that to a pendrive using USBinstaller, and then used that pendrive to install to a usb HDD. so the OS is installed on a 1tb usb hdd at the moment. because my bios is crappy, I have to use grub4dos and plop to boot the usb hdd
ok what happens when you boot it ?
which gets me to the ubuntu user login screen (gui). before i get there. i can an error could not call CWAP(1). but it continues to boot. then, I type in my password. i get the welcome sound. but it freezes just after the sound finishes
did you do an md5 on it first?
yah.... this is my 2nd install. it was doing it last time. so i wiped the drive, reformatted and repartitioned, checked the md5 and did a fresh install
ok  what os areyou using to make the iso burn windoz or unix. ?
CD/DVD drive in laptop is bricked (bad firmware flash) so I put the iso on a 4gig flashdrive with - http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/

and what program 
pendrive linux universal usb installer (http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/)
just out of curiosity, does anyone know what the "Yes" script is for?
it sends an infinite series of 'yes' to stdout. or whatever you tell it to
yeah i noticed, just havent been able to use it yet
you pipe it in to programs that prompt you endlessly to just answer yes to everything. it's kind of useless these days
yes I know lol, I was just saying I couldnt figure out HOW to set the target for output
did ubuntu get a kernel update recently. last couple of days for 16.10
yes
how often does that usually happen?.  I know there is not a set schedule. it seems it happens often
usual kernel updates come every 2-3 weeks. security fixes are shipped asap after testing
do you normally do a full reboot then or you use a program that installs an update without reboot?
yes. kernel updates need full reboot. for 16.04 LTS (since that is what servers run) you can use the canonical live patch service.  i reboot my laptop at least once a day. so that is not an issue for me.
that can patch without reboot?. that live patch service?
hello all, I'm trying to install libsdl1.2-dev on ubuntu 14.04 but it's saying I have unmet dependencies and won't install. it has also marked libgbm1 to be kept back
"source" in repositories is selected ?
it's partially checked, has the - rather than the checkmark
try to check it... (you can revert it)
just tried that and it keeps going from checked to partially checked. I'm assuming the Source Code checkbox in Software & Updates is what you are referring to
no Synaptic
ah okay, will look at that now.  where is the sources checkbox?
Settings - Repositories
that's the software & updates app I was in
Synaptic Package Manager ? and you can't check "source code" ?
using synaptic package manager and opening settings -> repositories opens the Software & Updates app. I can uncheck Source Code and then check it again but it has the - rather than the checkmark. It looks like I'm able to install the keptback package using synaptic though, so I'm doing that. Will see if it fixes the issue
Is there any way that I can disable my hardware drivers from a liveCD?
do you mean modify an installed system?
yessir
hmm.. with secureboot disabled the desktop isnt even showing. :S. stuck on the kde screen
is it 16.04 or 16.10?
its 16.10

one thing you could do is install the live-dvd or check if there's a repository dvd available.
i have installed ubuntu 2 monts ago. I have a live cd, and thats all. There isn`t much on it. and i insstalled everything from it
I was talking about live-DVD.
I know, i dont have one
On release candidate version of Ubuntu, is there a GUI way of creating a CD from an iso?
right-click on the iso i believe
OK, I'll give that a crack. But as I recall, I think I tried that. Maybe I have to move the iso into nautilus first.

I've had trouble getting it to work reliably. Once nVidia supports the new XRandR 1.2, it'll be a snap....  for now, though, you can put it into the 'Device' section of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file..  it's just one line, Option "RandRRotation" "true"

anyone have a rough time frame for zeroing out a 500 gig drive hooked up usb, using dd?
3 hours at least.  most likely much more
Thanks 
on a scsi 15000 rpm drive at 80gigs it takes 45 minutes,,.  on usb connection that same drive would take a few hours
sata hooked up usb. thanks  just means I have to wait till later tonight to reinstall the os on my laptop. finally configured my windows VM for work so I can stop duel booting
well once the command has been used by the drive,, zeroing move as fast as the drive can handle.  i would just start the zeroing and go watch a few movies or something :)

I need to install Ubuntu on a laptop that has the boot sector occupied already (meaning Grub can't install to it). Where should I move it to (dualboot with an existing Vista install) so that it doesn't cause problems. I have to resize Vista yet anyway.. ?
. move grub to the boot partion that you created on the ubuntu disk
Ok, so when I resize Vista, it will use say the first half of the drive right? Then I just make a few EXT3 partitions for Ubuntu and make one a /boot?
if you install grub to the mbr you still will be able to boot windoze vista
And the computer will use Grub like normal?.  I can't. I got Truecrypt encrypting my whole hard drive.
remove it.  we have better then true link
If I remove it my computer will become unusuable.
then dont
I'd have to decrypt everything..  Can I use the Vista bootloader somehow?
make one /boot partiton at +32m . make one swap partition with +512m . make one partion / with the remaining space
Uhh whoops?. !ops. Thanks.
windows will not allow it. windows will only accept windoze. there are alternatives to grub that are windows installable however ......google
Ok. Yeah I think I will. :\
have fun. hehehehehehe
Hence the !ops command.. :D

im, saying there are ways it may allready be disabled...
Well no. It's enabled. It's a bug in recent X.
hi. I'm trying to install my pctv tv card, my dmesg contains " Pinnacle PCTV Stereo (saa7134) [card=26,insmod option]" does this mean I installed my tv card drivers correctly?

ok, hi, I want to let someone on the other side of the internet use my machine via vncviewer, but my machine is behind a cablemodem/router, do I give them the IP address of the modem for them to connect?
yes. also setup the router to direct vnc traffic to the linux box
this is called port forwarding? how do I know the port for vnc?.  and that would be modem firmware settings yes?
ususually 5900 or 5901. see man page.  modem 'firmware' - actually firewall
ok, but I change firewall settings in the modem firmware, or does Ubuntu have a default firewall too?
is there any way to name the partition mounts without using some tool like gparted on a usb drive?

AnyIdea's Minimec ?
Hmmm... Unfortunally I cannot know, what and where you 'copy-pasted'. As I understand, you needed to install some dirvers, because the kernel had none. Is that correct?
It showed the wireless card, but it said it connected but it still didn't work....Minimec.. I read I had to install some drivers.... It might be better if I reinstall the whole ubuntu, then ask here for help.... Minimec

Hi, I upgraded to 16.04.3 and the 4.10 kernel seems to have broken some stuff. Is there any way to move back to the 4.4 or 4.8 kernels? Grub soesn't seem to want to add them to the bootlist
im not sure how to downgrade, but what kinda stuff has been broken? maybe we can fix that
hehe. Suspend got fritzy. I don't REALLY want to downgrade, I just can't figure out how to get the 4.4 kernel entry included in the grub bootup menu. update grub only sees the 4.0 kernel. 4.10* kernel
update-grub doesnt work?
it seems to work, but it doesn't make an entry for each kernel on my machine
have you rebooted since the upgrade?
several times...
uname -a
is this abberent behavior?.  4.10.0-32-generic #36~16.04.1-Ubun.  I thought it was just some new feature of grub2
thats the right kernel your in good shape :)
but 4.8 and 4.4 seem to work better on this old hardware
how so?. what broke?
the 4.10 kernel will not resume after a suspend.  the 4.4 kernel does for instance.  I thought the 4.8 kernel did too...
so it will suspend cleanly but not wake ?
it would be hard to debug without serial console, the hardware is very 'exotic' it is a dual quad core xeon macpro2,1. from 2006
well never had to sort that out before, but found this guide.... https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingKernelSuspend.  so just to make sure, the old kernel images are still in /boot right?
right, but to debug the system would take more hardware than I have.  right, all the images are where they should be.  maybe I don't understand the boot menu entries..  I will RTFM.  Thanks for your help. Does update-grup also perform a grub-install?
shouldnt need to grub-install
I thought so too...
but should be able to edit /etc/default/grub to show the other kernel versions.  https://askubuntu.com/questions/82140/how-can-i-boot-with-an-older-kernel-version. should fix ya up
right... ... but i am not sure i see the 4.4 and 4.8 kernel entries in the grub menu.  ahhh Advanced options for Ubuntu. okay, see oldtimers like me get confused when stuff is so pretty and tucked away. Hehe I still feel nostalgic for grub1 and sysV... gotta learn all this new stuff for ubuntu.  thanks again
anytime buddy.. dont worry im back to the learning curve with ubuntu as well and lots changed since in my absense haha happy to help!
have you seen journalctl -xe?
sure havent, whats that?
try it. it is sorta amazing for debug. it is the systemctl logging frontend. or something
ahhh... sounds pretty snazzy, ill take a peek. thank you :).  you pretty good with samba connections?
not since 2008....  how bad is it?.  I gotta reboot to see if I can get the older kernel working.. have fun with journalctl -xe
Hey all, I have grub installed and menu.lst exists, but when I boot grub drops into the commandline. i think i have rerun grub-install at some stage, any ideas how to fix it so the menu shows up by default? (I use "configfile (hd0,0)/grub/menu.lst" to load the menu manually at the moment)
run grub from the command line, then use the root and setup commands..  most likely root (hd0) then setup (hd0)

Just installed Win7 on a 1.5TB HDD with AHCI, it partitioned it in GPT. When I boot to the Ubuntu installer, gparted shows the entire disc as unallocated, yet it mounts to the desktop automatically with the filesystem intact.. I left 200GB at the end free for Ubuntu, is there a reason why parted reports the entire disk unallocated? Is there a problem installing Ubuntu to a GPT-partitioned disk?
There is nothing wrong with installing Ubuntu to a GPT disk. The reason gparted likely sees it as being unnalocated is that you have an invalid partition table, possibly due to overlapping partitions. You can confirm this by running "sudo parted -l".
Hmm.. "sda contains GPT signatures, etc... However, it does not have a valid fake msdos partition table, as it should.". Interesting. wtf did 7 do to this partition table?
Windows can't boot from GPT on BIOS systems to it creates a hybrid GPT/MBR partition table which violates the GPT specification.
Right, but parted is indicating that the MBR portion is missing?
hello, could you help me ? My usb stick has crashed. I cannot mount it . I only have /dev/sdb . Do you have something to suggest me ?
Run lsusb and post output, does other things work with that usb port
yes, everything works fine . http://paste.ubuntu.com/5616614
Idk what to say, restart system and try again?.  Is this an ongoing issue?
yes.. nothing works after many restart.. fdisk doesn't show my usbstick. Same results after several restart.  but dmesg return me detection output. maybe some of you, know a tools to for usb recovery
Dumb question, but have you confirmed the stick is working on other distros/cpus?
yes. it's not a new one. Yesterday it was working
Can you format it, or do you have important stuff on there?.  And was it working on that distro yesterday?
yes.  that's way I m sure , usb stick is down. And I m trying to recover data
I'm having some issues getting sound to work (ICH5 AC95) even though install detects everything and all levels look good. I had the system system working with an Audigy card, but pulled it from the PC to get on-board working.
what is the onboard card?
it's an Intel ICH5 AC95 compliant (built-in on an Asus mobo)
is it one of those hda chipsets?
HDA? not sure what that is. It's an old Socket 478 mobo with AGP
open up a terminal and "lspci" and see exactly how it idenfiies your sound device
I've checked that out before, but it is: Intel Corporation 82801EB/ER (ICH5/ICH5R) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 02).  oops, AC97 compliant, sorry.  aplay -l reports two devices at bus 0 and 4, both AC97
ok seems like i have to save state again maybe
In case I'm not around later, there's one more command you will probably need: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start

mobi-sheep, i followed all the links but i still cant find an app that would back up HD to HD automatically
a script and a cron job
considering i know little about scripting - how difficlut would that be?
Not difficult at all. If you know the commands you want to use you just put them in a file and mark it executable, more or less.  With cron you could just put the command in your crontab even
can i use a rsync command ?
yes.  See "man 5 crontab" for information about how to set the schedule, then you just put the command afterwards
cron comes with ubuntu right? so i just need to figure out the command and put in cron cron-tab? how do i make it back-up every night at 9 oclock?.  ok,,,,is there a gui for cron?
I'm trying to set up surround sound. When I play music I only get sound from rear left, rear right, and subwoofer.

Do live usb persistence files work on mac?
should do, i think
Mine keeps getting wiped :/
in theory, the kernel modules needed for mac-on-linux should be built into dapper.... but when I try to startmol, it complains about missing modules
gretyl: try a sep drive and boot clean.. gretyl: they are all of about 40 bucks these days and they save a ton of hassle.
I just installed dapper yesterday, shouldn't need a fresh install already...
gretyl: then i misunderstand your question. gretyl: try me again maybe. gretyl: grey matter might work better this time.
I'm having trouble starting up mac-on-linux
gretyl: what is that? you mean you are having trouble booting your machine running linux that happens to be motorola / ppc powerd?. gretyl: last time a checked a 'mac' was nothing more than a motorola / ibm chip with a bunch of other garbage components.
no, mac-on-linux is an environment where a PPC machine booted into Linux should be able to load Mac OS X inside a window
gretyl: ahhhhh..... gretyl: probably not the _defacto_ forum for mac questions.. gretyl: linux yes.. gretyl: but when you get back into mac, you are begging for pain.
well, it's the linux pkg that's failing me. not the mac part

theres no reason to install 13.10. 13.10 loses support in less than 3 months
nah i installed 14.04 on a friends comp and it crashed each hours. hour*
ok, that still doesn't make it a good idea to install 13.10
mmmm yeah. you're right maybe 12.04 would be better
or figure out the problem and use 14.04
I would like to stop the "extra" folders being created when creating a new user (in /home/newuser/ directory). Does anyone know where I should be looking? (it doesn't seem to be anywhere in the skel dir...)

thanks, but it is a little more complex - I am doing via a gui...
i know that this is a channel for ubuntu , but i tryied on networking channel to ask something and no one ... answered. my question is, how can i find out all the ip's connected to my modem ?
scan the network
how ? netstat ?
i would use nmap
i don't have nmap installed
sudo apt-get install nmap
and if i want to have also installed the manual ? is there any way to install the manual for nmap (man nmap for ex)
can anyone recommend an IRC server for a LAN?
ircd :D
thanks
learn to use apt-cache search. :)
don't be patronizing. I asked for a recommendation
I modified /etc/passwd by hand to add an account, but now passwd says "Authentication service cannot retrieve authentifcation info". how do I fix this
- use the command sudo adduser .... to add a user to the system - see man adduser for info
I would have loved to, but I had to change the UID numbers of two accounts so they'd match up with my laptop for NFS.  I've done this before on other Linux's and never had this problem
wouldnt waste my time on certifications.. very useless
you need them to get a job. period.
i have 1 (A+) and that's it. Ive been in the field for about 7 years.  my cert did nothing for me
yup, and EVERYBODY requires A+, even though the cert is 100% shite. but without it you cant even get a lowly tech position
most of the people where i work dont have any cers. certs*
where do you work? I need a job.. cause i have YEARS of real world experience
you have any experience?.  professional experience?
a couple years. but nothing in any one specialization. that's where having a cert or two would be nice
looks like its desktop support world for you ;).  what area of the world you live in?
not if i get these certs... i guarantee they'll land me a sysadmin or sysop position. ohio, usa. they just look all kinds of official, heh
good luck, i really hope it works like that for you.  what would be your ideal (realistic) job you would like to do?
I want to build call-center networks.. I have a knack for large-scale user networks
what kind of jobs have you done in the past?.  in field i mean
How do i include a file to xinetd.conf?
isn't xinetd.d directory available?
yes it is...Every file i place in there will be executed at boot?
no, it will execute if xinetd is on
ok.  but doesn't xinetd normaly start when I boot a machine?
:-/ I would really like to have a user list for my general users
why don't you do an 'ls' to /home and copy the text
all that will do is tell you my home directories.
and all your users have a home directory
yes.  the user list was already working. then it just quit.
Should I go somewhere else?
have you tried removing it?
is it safe?. to unistall i mean....
sure you can put it back later if you wish
kk. Thanks man :D
np ;]
Should i remove it via apt-get remove?
from the panel? just right click should do it, unless you want to completely remove networkmanager and use only command line to connect to internet
no it doesn't give me that option. its just's managing my dhcp right.... and I don't need it to manage that, I setup my router to do that
any special reason to remove it?
no, i just want my panel to be 19 px and its too big and the icon wont resize so I just said, w/e and I'll remove it
so is 13.04 stable enough yet?
depends on the details.. stable enough for what? i have no issues with 13.04
well for example i installed 12.04 yesterday and my video drivers werent working properly, my max resolution was set to 1024
ok, so build essential is on now. do I type make yet?. oh hell, I am just gonna type make. oh crap I already typed make
that's ok, just hit control-c.  if you type make, it will ask you a bunch of questions.  but why is it you insist that you want to "just type make"?
It was... I feel great I have never compiled kernel before..  someone told me to do that ealrier
so, after a bit of work, you'll compile the kernel.  but if you convince yourself that you don't have to do any work, what happens when you get to a step you don't understand?
I dig down deep, swallow my pride and move onwards
hello, where do i go for support for landscape?
did you purchase Landscape instances from Canonical?
im using the trial version at the moment
walterego, umask 0f 000 = no access (as far as I'm aware) and doesn't Vista default to NTFS not FAT ?
Distrojockey: I set up a FAT32 partition to hold personal folders
ahh
I have umask=003. Works for all folders except for those that are linked to the personal folders in Vista
sorry, bit out of my area
it's a really strange problem that can't seem to be solved by simply doing some fstab stuff.. Distrojockey: so it seems to be for everybody :(
links to FAT should be fine, and access to them from Vista should also be painless
accessing from Vista is painless. Accessing from Ubuntu isn't. That's the thing..  Linking to it is fine as well
FAT does'nt even have permisions, so no idea what the issue could be, sorry
thanks for looking at it, I think I'll bump the thread once (or is that not allowed) and then maybe file a bug report
not sure on bumping rules but it has been a while, so worth a try.  good luck
Is there any music player that supports hierarchical playlists, like a folder called 'Classical', under that 'Mozart', and under that 'Symphonies'?
indexed by the 'genre' tag? rhythmbox has a nice track browser
I'm using rhythmbox...I was thinking of the play queue vs. play list.. My geekbook starts with my account open. It doesn't present a login screen... what to do?
hey all.....upgrade to Hardy seems to be just chilling on "Configuring locales" for a while now...........is this normal?
Yeah, for a little while.
it DOES take awhile?
It generates the locales. Depends on the speed of you r computer
I'm watching it in the terminal.......It's still on the first one (en_AU.UTF-8)......for about 15 min now. but i'll keep my eye on i. t. thanks
That certainly sounds wrong. Mine takes 1-2 min to do all
uh oh....
Installing or upgrading?
upgrading
You could try stopping it, and then run dpkg -configure -a
how do I "stop" the upgrade?. just kill it?
Ctrl+C :-)
I'm using the GUI. not directly from the CLI
ohh..try closing the windows then, if not you have to go into the terminal and kill it there, or the system monitor
yeah the "Close" option is grayed out. guess i'll manually have to kill it. this isn't gonna be pretty,...........................
nope...
good thing for TimeVault
is it normal for "anthy" to take 2 hours to configure on an ubuntu install?
for japanese/etc input?
yeah. and I dont need that package
hi, do you know any app where it's possible to track time and give a per hour cost? something like that?
like a net cafe POS software?
well somehow similar, but i need to to track my work
QUESTION: Is there a UI for linux that is in openGL?
compiz-fusion
thank you, any good documentation on installing that windowmanager with ubuntu?
it's well integrated -- 'System-Preferences-Appearance-Desktop Effects'
I just bought a dell m4300 with a quadra gfx card... I am hoping it does a really nice job with this UI you speak of
it'll only work once you've enabled 3D acceleration on the driver side.
so just install normal ubuntu? no Kubuntu or Xubuntu?
Hi all, I am having issues on a 8.0.4 LTS installation where I cannot seem to get new cron jobs to run
does the system have a desktop UI?
in root user, ran crontab -e, added * * * * * /bin/echo "Test" >> /tmp/test123.txt. any ideas?
does the system have a desktop UI?
no only cli
is cron running as a service?
Yea i ran ps aux | cron
what does: service cron status output?
returns usage, (start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload)
then you didnt run it right.
there are already crons running, checked syslog /USR/SBIN/CRON[21656]: CMD (/bin/local/qd live >/dev/null 2>&1)
Lucid: How can I arrange the symbols on the GNOME desktop automatically in a grid (matrix) so that they will not overlap (similar to Windows XP)?

No sir. I have asserted this context menu item. Still my desktop does not arrange items in a grid.
hi i am experience issues using linuxdpp, has anyone used it. ?
what issues?
koenigsegg the issue is that even though it connects me to the dc serverr and chat rooms and i can talk to everyone on the main chat and privately. When it comes to searching through the shared files or getting file lists i get no responses. Zilch! how do i configrue this ?
sounds like the usual thing with closed ports.
how do i fix the port problem
you have to configure your firewall, router etc to not block these ports and just let the data through
I dont know how to do it. koenigsegg ok ill try fixing my port issus. *issues
Is it typical for Ubuntu to report more HDD capacity than windows? Back when windows was installed as the only OS it showed 80GB hd capacty, Ubuntu shows 150GB
hm. and how big should the disk be?
I'm not sure actually..  windows said 60, Ubuntu says 150
yes, but how big is it really? i mean whats written in the label?
I'd have to take it out to find out
and where do you see that space? the disk free application for example summs up all memory it finds, not just the 1st hd

Anyone got the skype linux client working on ubuntu (feisty specifically if that matters)? It's showing a distinct lack of letting me sign up for an account.. (I was conjecturing some sort of connection problem, but it looks like it's able to connect)
sure
Did it require any magic?
not that I remember. sounds were a problem for a while
Did you have an account already, or were you signing up for a new one with that install?
Hello, is there anyone here who has successfully installed ubuntu on a surface book?. I can't get the wifi to work for more than a minute. after which time the kernel hits a bug and I have to reboot. I've tried 16.04 and 17.04. I've also tried installing kernel 4.11rc8 but it won't boot

One more shot- I'm running ubuntu on a santa rose macbook pro and no videos will play- it's a fresh install. I know I have to add something to xorg.conf and I know it has something to do with compiz- can anyone help out?
is X-windows running, or do you only have the text console?
I assume x-windows is running? I don't really know what that is.
do you have a colourful login screen, or just a black background with white text?
Colorful.
hey, are ther any known problems with atheros laptop wireless cards and poor signal reception??
well, it has happened before, if that's what you're asking... it's not really an ubuntu thing though, it's down to the laptop designer and where they put the antennas.
so it wouldn't be a driver issue

i'm having problems getting vnc working on ubuntu server 6.06, can anybody help me?
what's the problem?
hashbox: i installed tightvncserver and i kept getting font errors. hashbox: i eventually gave up and tried vnc4server and it claimed it started (vncserver) but i can't connect
I was googling vnc servers before and saw something related to tightvnc server and font problems. Hmmm do you know which port it is starting the server on?
hashbox: i could probably figure out which port, does ubuntu lock all ports until explicitly opened?
im not sure, you could have a look at netstat
hashbox: how do i interpret netstat output?
well somewhere you should see a localhost.someportthatlookslikevnc I think, im not really sure sorry
hashbox: dont see it, so how do i enable that port?
does vncserver say anything about a port when you start it?
hashbox: 5901
Hello! I have an AWS instance and I would like to pass all of its outgoing traffic via OpenVPN excluding incoming traffic to ssh. Could someone point me to the right direction or provide a reference? the only solution I found to avoid locking myself out of the server is to add a route rule in OpenVPN config with my IP. Is there a way to exclude incoming traffic from a specific port instead?
a vpn is a "tunnel".  everything goes down the town. down the tunnel.  you'd been to have pre-routing rules based on interfaces
I try to exclude specific services. I googled but I'm not the most experienced in networking
you can use iptables to setup port style routing rules.  what are you actually trying to do and why. it seems an odd situation
I use the AWS instance as desktop. I would like when I browse not to expose my IP but I would like to be able to ssh and remote desktop to it
AWS IP - who cares ?. it's not "yours"
it's perfectly mine alright
i seem to have a problem playing any audio on my system, i can play flash and mp3's and stuff like that just fine, but no audio ever comes out. i seem to have a problem playing any audio on my system, i can play flash and mp3's and stuff like that just fine, but no audio ever comes out anybody got thoughts to what the problem might be?. i seem to have a problem playing any audio on my system, i can play flash and mp3's and stuff like that just fine, but no audio ever comes out anybody got thoughts to what the problem might be?

does anyone here use geforce 8 series?
I do .. 8600 GTS
are you able to use the accelerated graphics?
Yes  I had to download the new drivers manually from nvidias website.
what all do i have to?.  and it seems the latest drivers for windows are horrible
its pretty easy, you need the linux-headers package installed and then just run the nvidia installer from their website in sudo.
hmmm
Well the new drivers are the only ones that support my new video card.
same here i believe but they aren't running right.  i keep getting yellow screens on higher settings
ahh sorry can't help much there I stop at 1280x1024 on mine.
i was using 1024x768!
are you using the drivers from their website?.  wht kind of card do you have?
8800 GTS 320MB
[Q] how can I unmerge mailx and emerge nails? All google gives me is gentu not ubuntu
> You're using apt-get and not emerge in ubuntu... right?
correct
if i want to use vnc to access my computer over the internet, is it necessary to use ssh or is the vnc security enough
vnc is no security (no encrytion at all)
i see so all i have is the password right?
yes, but it's not very secure and vnc happended to have bad bugs regarding security in the past. Passwordhash is passed over the net....  toys like cain do crack the password if traffic is captured...
so you'd recomment ssh? its just that i can't work out how to do X forwarding with it
it always depends on what you want to do with it - but yes, in all my szenarios ssh is involved.  please explain what you want to do and I can make a suggestion
well i want to be able to access my desktop from windows and run apps from there
do you need to access a running desktop or is that not needed? also good to know - what system are you running at work?.  doh.  just read the windows part of your post... ok, still it depends. it is less intrusive on the windows machine to use ssh/vnc to connect to a running desktop session at home....  is your home machine directly connected to the net or is it connected to a router that is going online?
its going through a router
ok, so you already have configured the router to route incoming ssh traffic (port 22) to your machine?
no not yet, the only time i use ssh is over the internal network anyway, but i can do it now
you should do so to make your home machine be available from the outside. Also a machanism to find your machine from work would be great.You can use something like dyndns.org or just write down your ip and hope it won't change....  next thing is to activate the buildin vnc server on your ubuntu box
im running a netgear router, i have selected the inbound service as ssh. is the LAN server just my ubuntu pc's ip?
After updating to Raring, certain kernel modules are missing. what could be the problem?
WE can't help unless you are more vague. ;)
okay, I updated to Raring, and it came with a new kernel, 3.8.0-19-generic. when I boot with the new kernel, my display is detected at the lowest resolution, my wireless and wired networking isn't working, usb devices are not working, and probably more... when I boot with the old kernel, Raring seems to work without issues.
Have you checked the additional drivers in software and updates?
what do you mean?. also comparing lsmod, only about half of the modules are being loaded compared to the older kernel version
look for software and updates in the last tab is additional drivers. When you upgrade many have to be reloaded.. nvidia drvers b43 wireless...etc
okay, is there a best way to recompile the modules against the new kernel?.  I have needed to do that when working with other distrobutions but never with ubuntu. I excpected that it would have happened automatically during the dist upgrade
i get something like this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/60620/. musik
unfortunately, I don't know how to assist with that... I would suggest posting that information at the forums, because line 32 looks like it should then mount
should i format my harddrive and reinstall ubuntu?
hey guys, im using thunderbird, but i keep getting an error from the smtp server saying that my email address is not validated. I've succesfully used thunderbird on previous installations. this is really annoying now cause im unable to send any mail with it. has any got any ideas on the cause or a fix. if not is it possible to use a different smtp server thing?
make sure you have a username/password specified in your thunderbird smtp settings
they are, and there both correct
dunno then. check your isp? does another client work (i.e. evolution)?
ive had this client working on previous installations, it collects emails, but doesnt send them
collecting is pop3 or imap. sending is smtp. If you are getting error that username or password is not right, then sounds like isp question
ok, how do i check what my isp is and what its set to in thunderbird?
your isp would be whoever supplies your internet connection.

i just installed a fresh copy of 12.04 which i had running before. it installed the right nvidia driver before through a popup dialog that came from the top right of the screen. i don't know what made it come up before but is there a way to trigger this or something?
theres an additional-drivers tab. in the 'software sources' tool in 12.10
i went back to 12.04. does this exist somewhere?
darn
if you HAVE to be able to write on the ntfs partition, you could try using captive. But it's very slow and hasn't been developped the last few years

no

anyone know how to resize the / partition by decreasing the size of another partition. both in use.
gparted from a live system, re-checking fstab
ok. thank you :)
it must NOT be mounted for that
how is the partitions and storage handled while using live cd then  ?
well gparted won't resize on a mounted drive, but while running from another os, the hd doesn't need to be.  if it is automounted, gparted offers you to unmount it. (cd )
hmm what do you recommend for the / part ? I ran 7gb this time. but obviously it wasnt enough :D

someone please help me with the sudo command.... when i run without sudo the system finds the path, however with sudo the system cant find it...what is the problem?
what you mean by find the path ?
i mean the command rake (options) work....however sudo rake options, will raise "command not found"
locate "which rake" and see if root have access to it
which rake prints 'usr/local/bin/rake'.  however that is not the right path , that path would be /usr/local/lib/jruby-1.5.0.RC3/bin , how can i change the rake path?
Qowao:can you resize them?
no

not sure if this would be better suited on ##linux or here, but, been recently having some issues with sudo. Atm, every time I use sudo, all terminals end up unresponsive, and new processes can't be started either, and shutdown breaks too. If I don't use sudo, everything works just fine. (13.04 x64 on mbp, worked fine on initial install, broke down after updating). Wondering if it's a known issue perhaps,. and/or how I can begin to diagnose the issue (no errors until it hangs, at which point I can't check the errors)
weird
oh, and if I d/c, I should be back w/in 5 minutes; having sporadic connection issues recently xD (unrelated to ubuntu)
i'd fsck for start
any recommended flags that I should use for fsck?
-v maybe.  also smartctl
weird, finished pretty quick, don't think it found any errors, but, works fine o_O ; thanks I guess lol

what video card? what ubuntu release
newest release, Nvida GeForece 9600m GT. Force*. i see it in Software center?

i just restarted my computer and i have no sound. how would i fix this?
alsamixer on the command line
i have gnome alsamixer but nothing necessary appears to be muted.
if you are able to unmute or turn it up, then alsactl -store (or something similiar) you can check out the man page for alsactl for exact command, 'man alsactl'.  is it a laptop ?
yep.
. is f8 the speaker key ?. anyone know about my update problem ? why it would be resolving the update addresses to localhost or 0.0.0.0 ?
f8 is my wireless key. Fn esc is mute/unmute and Fn 1 and 2 are volume.
so i have ubuntu installed on a machien but its all corrupted and i want to reinstall. but im doing it via distance for my mom and she cant seem to get her uefi machine to show the usb stick. can i force ubuntu into some recovery mode
hold shift at boot for grub=> and choose ubuntu recoverymode
it doesnt show that option. it shows the advanced recovery screen but no options
choose the second line under your normal ubuntu line
there isnt one
hmm
the problem is getting the usb key to boot. i dont remember how i installed it on her machine but im 2000 miles away, so i just text her how to do it
bios set to usb first
apparently that isnt an option
most recent bios have that option.  f12 can give boot menu on some machines also
she keeps trying and nothing happens at all. or so she says. ive looked at the pictures and it just shows the HDD twice and a lan boot option. nothing more. its a very new machien
some bios have 2 settings for boot.  boot sequence and boot order
hat could be the issues, its quite hard to troubleshoot from a distance. is there anyway i could get into her machine before ubuntu boots, since the interent is not working on ubuntu. well then i have to hope my mom will press he right keys somehow

lshw -C network
well shes not online now
her wifi worked before?
yes it was fine
broke after an update?
idk there were issues with skype. then i tried to fix netflix. which i did and hten she said the wifi icon disappeared then i tried to fix apt and i killed it
what did you do exactly to fix netflix?
the problem was i added an extra libnss. and which caused some dependancy issue. which could not be resolved so itried to delete all of the libnss. which sitll didnt fix it and it killed hthe wifi
How can i use relative path names with respect to the dir in which my shell script resides in?
use "./file".  actually.... $(dir $0)/file
no i didnt mean that.
better yet: SCRIPTDIR=$(dir $0) ; MYFILE=$SCRIPTDIR/file
my shell script copies a file from a relative path with respect to its path..  one sec. i'll pastie it
if you need to be able to go from a relative path to a full path: the accepted way is to change to that directory and get its location, then change back to the original dir as necessary.  cd $(dir $0); SCRIPTDIR=$PWD ; cd -

howdy. so just a question, could my dhcp lease time be the reason i couldnt connect for 2 days?
if all your ip's in the ip range were taken up
thing is that right now it gave me the same ip that my windows boot is using, does it assign a specific ip to a specific mac adress or soemthing?
na i think dhcp will ping the ip everynow and then and if it doesnt reply it will release it so you can use it again. is your windows dual boot or another machine completely?
how long does it hold it for? and yep, for now, trying to migrate to ubuntu for sound, just taking a while to get it all going..wierd on the dhcp thing, i dont want to be without a conncetion for another 2 days:P

try your ./configure and look at the errors you get.  they will suggest what is missing
but it must be broken on my comp. it wont let me get build-deps for any package
I have a strange issue in dapper, clean install, where in programs like evolution, gedit and a few others, in the menus it displays like this : "New keyboard label|Ctrl+N". the "keyboard label|" bit is what's odd.. its all over the place
is your home directory from a previous version?
sort of.. I used to have breezy, then dist-upgraded to dapper. but because of instability I re-installed clean, and kept my home folder.
the only problem w/ doing that is you carry over all the old configs which might not be right. If instead you move your old home dir to a new directory name before you install, then your user will be created with the right config files in the home dir and you can copy over your data (non .files) from your old home dir
I didn't want to do that, since I would loost all of my customisations / settings from apps. I thought it would be ok, since I was using dapper anyway.
dunno, but I had that same thing happen to me. and it was solved by making a new admin user, then using that admin user to remove my user (after moving the non-config files) then recreating my user and moving my files back
hrm. I gues I'll have to do that.
you can always try moving over the important configs (firefox etc).  as those are probably fine
yeah, and evolution
How do I edit my keyboard layout (edit != change)? I want to swap my ctrl and alt keys so that using Emacs doesn't hurt.

Can someone tell me how to make a Symlink in the "My Computer"
"My Computer" is gnome-vfs only, you won't be able to create a symlink, AFAIK.  however, you might create a launcher for it
I'm not sure how to name the components... the this is yesterday when I mounted the volumes they were added on the Desktop and search menu for instance
gconf-editor->apps->nautilus->computer_icon_visible
when but that would show only the computer icon on the desktop. Not the /media/Windows and /media/Storage being the two mounted volumes
gconf-editor->apps->nautilus->volumes_visible
well there is already a check mark :(
you can also make links to /media/Windows.  etc, ...  I guess volumes only mean removable storage in this case
this seems to be so simple and easy I can't find it on the forums

Any ideas on why, in simple scan, xubuntu detected the scanner automatically, but wheezy didn't?
compare the output of "dpkg-get-selections > pkgs.txt" on both machines. Chances are you are missing something in Debian, probably a nonfree package.
good idea
that should be "dpkg --get-selections"
in wheezy dpkg --get-selections is huge! Is there anything in particular I'd be looking for?
"dpkg --get-selections |grep ^i" will limit it to installed packages, probably more useful to compare the output of that on both machines..  erm sorry, that is for apt-get/aptitude, "dpkg --get-selections |grep install".  if you want to be sure "dpkg --get-selections |grep -w install$".  IIRC, debian shows you the state of all packages (deinstall, install, purge etc.) while by default the Ubuntu version only shows installed packages.
Okay - I see.
there is probably a cleaner way to do it (I imagine a parameter or something), but I have been using that command since the 90s
: Is there a particuler word that is associated with printers or scanners?
anyone got the Beryl thingy going
I have compiz on my edgy box, but I don't actually use it. too quirky on my ati card
oh well at least ya got it running, is it any different than beryl? ive got compiz on this now but id like beryl, i see its much better at visual movement
I have beryl on a gentoo box, but its an nvidia card so I don't know how much that accounts for a difference. It seems like beryl is easier to administer though
does it look like compiz? as far as the visuals go? or is it much better. I'd like to put beryl as a separate session

How do I replace the bad repository version of nicotine+ with the good current version from the nictone website?

Hey guys, i was reading some about file permissions and was wonder if there some overlap between chmod, sticky bits, and suids?
you use chmod to change permissions, sticky bits are chmod 1xxx and used for like /tmp so anybody who creates a file nobody else can delete it, suid is chmod 4xxx and it's so a program can run as the owner of the file, like sudo is suid so anybody who runs it can get root privileges if it wants to let him
yes but isnt there also a linux program to change the suid like setsuid which sounds like it also does the same thing as chmod setting those bits?
not sure, i dont think so
i think it is something like this http://linux.die.net/man/2/setgid http://linux.die.net/man/2/setuid

Hello all, I created an ext4 partition on my USB harddrive using gparted. Now when I plug it in to Ubuntu 12.04, I don't have write access. I suspect I can fix this in fstab, but shouldn't any USB drive be mounted by my user by default? Is there something fundementally wrong with the partition I created?
actually, change the mount points permission...
Hm, so I should try chmod on /media/mydrivename?
fstab is only required for permissions when you use FAT/NTFS (none native filesystems)
I see. Going to try chmod now..  I see that my ext4 drive is owned by root in /media. Another random USB drive I plug in (FAT32) is owned by my user.

Okay. Configuration looks good. I think it's some issue with the pc of your sister
but... it worked well with Windows.... let me reconnect all the cables and switches
Maybe it's a simple problem with the cabling, yes. Inside the web interfaces of most routers you can see when there is a successful ethernet link
no, resetted everything :(. to no avail :(. that is making me crazy
does the network card have a link?
I have heard this question before, I would love to just give an access to this pc to someone, like you, just don't know how?

awesome! tyvm for your help. very much appreciated!
there is a CPU thermal module (aka fan)... bet that fan is dead... the service manual has the exact part #, so you can find it on ebay or something...
ty again will definitely check it out.
lol, sorry... no gpu fan, but I'm sure you'll find what is or isn't working with that service manual ;)
why would vim throw this error /bin/sh: /usr/bin/esd: not found
esd is a deamon.  would most likely be started from /etc/init.d/
i dont want esd, i dont use gnome.  besides, why would vim need it
Is there a boot parameter for the 17.10 USB Live environment to boot into Xorg instead of wayland? (My Matrox Millenium G550 produced weird artifacts.)
I'm thinking if you boot with nomodeset it shouldnt go to Wayland
thanks, i'll try! If i recall correctly, that fixed wayland issues on my nvidia box about a year ago (fedora)
because nvidia blob wants eglstreams, and a year ago nothing supported that. gnomes mutter apparently supports it now tho, but no other compositor I know of.  as per usual a case of nvidia being nvidia
nomodeset seems to have worked, not verified whether wayland is active but those artifacts are gone now ...thanks again
Can someone please tell me the correct command to set read,write,execute privileges for user "deluge" on all files in /var/lib/deluge/.config ? Is it "sudo -u deluge chmod -R u+rwx /var/lib/deluge/.config" ?
almost.  chmod sets read,write,execute permissions, chown sets the owner and group. so if you wanted deluge user to access those files you'll need to either set the files as word write/readable or set them as owned by deluge. using chown deluge /path/to/deluge/files.  furthermore, using sudo -u deluge tells sudo to run the following commands AS the deluge user. Which wouldn't do anything unless the deluge user had write permissions on the files already
ok... well my ultimate goal is to copy the folder & contents of ~/.config/deluge to /var/lib/deluge/.config/deluge and change read/write access permission for the copied file to the deluge user. What specific commands should I enter to do this?
hi all
hi
modem with sound can be supported?
if i tar something and i tell it --exclude=./.*, would that not exclude config files
only if those config files exist in that directory and have filenames that begin with a .
right ok but would that include directories name .*
aye -- if you do echo .* you should see it globbed
well on the output it has been saying ./.Trash/whatever.file, is it still ignoring those?
maybe --exclude=.* ??
i will try it, thanks.  very good its working1
can we check hard disk life (external via USB) using smartmon?
no
what is smart actually? a chip resides on the mobo or the hard disk?. though -d option is usable. but seems can't figure out which one is right
anyone knows convenient lan scanner?
I was confusing "USB CD" with my DVD drive. USB CD was at the top.
hmm maybe. Sonetimes it can't be seen unless you have something in it.  though if you have only one DVD drive what the hell is USB CD than?
I think I just ignored it because it has a long name. I think USB CD is boot from USB?
not sure. In general it's called USB volume and visible when usb is plugged in.  anyway, if your DVD is higher priority that HDD/SSD it should skip empty drives and try to load from next on in list
My DVD drive is ATAPI CD0 HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GUC0N . It wasn't at the top
it should be gigher that HDD / SSD.  *higher.  but it can be not the 1st one
Now I've changed it.  Why not?
loading just goes that way: check 1st drive. If exits - load.  if nothing in - go to 2nd in list.  so if you have only DVD in, it will anyway come to it
But I've just set it to be first?
ahh ok. just set first) it will be easier)
Ok. I wonder if I can leave quick boot on
just read later how it checks bootable devices. And how boot order works.  you can.  it's about testing.  and skipping some system tests.  you may have turn on legacy mode
anyway to reinstall ubuntu from command-line ?
sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop
is it possible to do it with ubuntu-server as well ?
how comprimised is a system whose etc backup is leaked ? :) which incldue /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
/etc/password is harmless, but if /etc/shadow has been leaked, you should have all users change their password
is the hashing still weak ? can it be attacked ?
Not sure what the default hash is now, but no matter how long it is, I wouldn't bet on it never being cracked
ok, those two are the first things i coudl think of, anything from top of your heads that could be important in /etc/* ?
Hi, I've "disabled" Network Manager but on boot I keep getting the message "waiting for network configuration", "Wait 60sec more for network configuration" - how do I prevent that? (network manager have been disabled by commenting "start on (local-filesystems and started dbus)" in /etc/init/network-manager.conf)
You probably want managed=false under the [ifupdown] section in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
it already says "managed=false" under /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

each machine should have one instance of avahi-daemon running.
are you sure that that would not provoke conflicts if they are running the same kind of services?
i am positive.

lets start with the basics. do you understand what avahi is for ?
yes. i do. i just need to know if the avahi-dns-daemon part will provoke conflict, as it sounded like it was keeping a cache and functioning as name resolver. whch could get kinda funky if there's like... thre of them
it only announces it's own hostname as a CNAME
i see. thank you very much for your help :)
actually it only announces its own hostname > ip as a CNAME after it hears a request for that hostname as a mulitcast queries.  no problems.
even if its serving services like dlna and things?
yes, it also announces services the host machine provides as TXT records.  you can see this info on your local network with avahi-discover
woa, that's convenient. thanks!

I need help reverting back to open source graphics drivers
be more specific
I installed proprietary drivers that don't work for my hardware.
which ones?.  which ones?
ATI. I'm currently runing Ubuntu off the liveCD.  I can mount my harddrive.
if you installed them in the livecd, then rebooting will fix it.  or are you using it repair another installation?
When I booted it after installation of the proprietary driver, I had black screen. I rebooted with liveCD and all was fine.
ah I see, are you on that computer now?
I am..  yeah
hmmm, easiest way is to boot into recovery mode (won't load the drivers, drops to a shell) then change your xorg.conf to not have Driver "fglrx" in it.  ^
And how do I go about doing that?
actually, you can do it from the liveCD if you can mount the HD
HD mounted...now what?
anyone using easyubuntu?
no, I use automatix2

Sweep audio editor fails, unable to open /dev/dsp. Installed oss-compat to no effect. Opening with pasdp gets playback with a load of static.. Any suggestions? Cause Sweep fulfilled fantasy audio features I wanted, and now doesn't work.
if your audio editor uses /dev/dsp perhaps it's time to find a more modern audio editor, or time warp back to 1995 ;) Good luck.
. I don't know of another editor that does some of the stuff Sweep does. :(

What's the most efficient virtualization that's supported on Ubuntu without hardware virtualization support?
virtualbox
does it have a server version?
yes, the nonfree Virtualbox supports remote viewing via vnc
ok, sounds good, thanks
its not comparible to vmware esx if thats what you mean by server version
no, for use on a server running ubuntu. Like KVM, but this machine doesn't have hardware support
ah like so, then yeah virtualbox is the easiest\
yeah, it sounds like the right solution... I just didn't think of it because I've only used it as a desktop solution befure. before*

how can i open the .iso file now. I located it
ok in unetbootin there is a button with ... on it,, click that , click the iso image,, and click ok,,.  or double click the iso image so that unetbootin will grab it.  but click that one button with the three dots on it to locate the iso file , then double click the iso file name and it should load in unetbootin
unebootin is asking me for location of disk image
right,, so when you click that button with three dots on it, a file window opens ,, locate the iso image with that

Hello. My computer connects to the Internet at some places but not at this one.. Wirelessly, that is.. My password is correct.
Whats does ifconfig display?
Huh. I am connected via IPv6.
IPv6 what country are you in?
USA. I am stoned and I could be wrong.. But I have an "inet6 addr".
then you don't need ipv6
I know, but I am connected via IPv6.. I'd rather use v4.. But I don't even know what I did here.
you you dont see inet addr:192.168.x.x ?. Why isn't avahi advertising my ssh server?
Negatory.
what does sudo iwconfig say?
So, I guess I'm not actually connected then.
I dunno send me a dpaste of the output of ifconfig
That would sound great but I'm not connected to the Internet.. No USB drives.. Wait, what the fuck?. I guess I am connected.. But to "".
when you type iwconfig it should say ESSID:"your network name" ### if it doesn't then your wireless isnt associated
It does. It says 'ESSID:""'.. "Link Quality=10/100".
ESSID what? tell me what the essid is.
"".
your not associated with your wireless ap then.  re associate and see what happens
I know, and I tried to associate with it.
are you using wep or wpa?
WPA.
and you typed in the right password and all

hello all. if i go to deactive 'gdm', it says that "this may effect the system in several ways, including data loss". why would that cause somehting like 'data loss'? i am wondering, does it affect automatic updates? is that why it says that?

type "grep ^ /etc/grub.d/* | nc termbin.com 9999"
What is that?
there's a file it adds in that dir i think
type that in the terminal?
it'll show the files and content and pastebin it and give a link, yes
http://termbin.com/utik
they're coming from /etc/grub.d/33_custom_proxy and 35_custom_proxy. if you wanna disable them, type sudo chmod -x /etc/grub.d/{33,35}_custom_proxy. then sudo update-grub
What does that command?
it removes executable bit for both files
are those files useless?
i dont have them they seem related to "proxified" somehow, but the files in them are useless, just all the .efi files picked up
done.  hopefully is all ok
updated grub?
Yes, done too
aha cool

tehdgm and i'm also at a dilemma where i have 4 primary partitions and cant create a swap for guini-pig sda4, so that is why i want to replace sda4 w/ an extended (my first priority right now)
i dont think you can move an existing primary inside an extended. I can see all sorts of stuff going wrong there
tehdgm can you have 2 extended on 1 drive?
holy crap user spam.  you dont need to, as you can have virtually unlimited paritions inside your extended
tehdgm can they all be primary? :P
they're "logical". But you can install an OS on them no problem. You might need to have your boot on a primary though
tehdgm just a few more questions and i should be well on my way :) is swap primary?
you can have your swap inside an extended just fine as far as i know. I think that is actually what i have on my main system.  you can even have multiple swap partitions on multiple discs
tehdgm yeah thats how i had it with what is now sda5/6. they were the only 2 in extended. sda4 was shrunk off of win7 at a later date and i split the swap in half that was in extended to share it between the 2 ubuntu partitions. tehdgm at first i tried without splitting the swap and (of course) hibernate would be lost when booting into the other OS.

Well. I get this error instlaling. "Debootstrap failed something or other". It's infamous on the forums. There was one solution but I didn't understand it; maybe you can explain it to me. Something about using "format as the method"; Ubuntu wants to format for itself even if it already is

thanks
no problem
but  port is open in roter and in ubuntu i cant to connecte
then you did something wrong maybe.  please ask your questions in the channel so that others can help and also benefit from the answers.  and NO I will not config your router. YOU are the admin and should never let anybody else have access to your router :).  if you are planning on running a ircd you will need to learn how to do these things yourself. it is not as hard as you may think, just takes some time and effort to learn :)

can you do the following "lsmod | grep "hcd""
done
what was the output of that command?
nothing, it just brought me down one line
issue the following command : sudo modprobe -i uhci_hcd
just brought me down one line again. no output
you should consider doing your work in a screen session

What would people recommend Raid 1 or Greyhole
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/greyhole see this page
Thanks kll but it still doesnt explain which is better. Basically I have two drives at 1TB they will store movies, pictures and music.. Which option would be best to mirror the other?
mirror? for speed improvment or for backup? because backup doesnt work that way
I suppose a backup of sorts but I would be backing up to a USB drive also.
neither of them both are meant for backup.
I would just like the safety if one hard drive were to fail I would have the data on the other.. And its easy to get the data off the other.
so you will be better with a singel hdd with a backup script that copies the data to the other one
So why not Greyhole or Raid 1 K1l?
its not a backup.  if you delete a file its still gone.
But if I delete a file then I dont want it anyway?
so ok. if you already choosen raid1 or greyhole then go for it.
No I haven't. I'm just curious with your answer.
9203 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1840.487 FPS. is this good?. i still have 100% cpu though
how well do actual 3d apps/games run?
i should install one :)
ok i may have found my problem. if i unplug my usb nic, then rmmod rt3572sta, lsmod no longer shows it. however, modprobe /lib/modules/......../net/wireless/rt3572sta.ko returns "FATAL: module /........./rt3572sta.ko not found." the file is there. but for some reason, 'modprobe rt3572sta' works. any ideas?
can you do strace on the modprobe to make sure it is openeinng the file you thought it was?
with the path or without?
is there a way i can tell whether or not iptables is being used right now, at this moment?
sudo iptables -L

is there a good fix for wine with pulseaudio using 9.10?
maybe try the wine ppa
thanks
or the other way round
how do I do it
what is the problem exactly
with wine, trying to use any app. it cuts out all other sound
ah yes
and then when I re open any other app, sound goes to the other apps and not the app with wine (ventrilo)
A family friend's Dell just quit working a few months ago, I went over and everything looked in place, so I went and got a new power supply, plugged it in, and it worked. Dell said she had a virus and needed a new PC.. I hate Dell.
thats the wonder new technical support from india dell is using
Hahaha yeah man, yay for outsourcing jobs.
yep
Those Dell commercials showing the nice, attractive, and young mid-20s female are so full of bullshit it makes my blood boil.. Not being racist here, but it's the truth.

(11:25:52 AM)  I've got a CD which contains both executables and CD audio. When prompted, out of curiosity, I decided to play it as a CD to see what the audio was like; now, I can't seem to get the system to read it as a game CD anymore. How do I fix that?
just go to "computer" in nautilus and explore the disc manually
Fryguy: Oddly enough, I can't seem to get it to cooperate in that regard, or I wouldn't ask.. Fryguy: Unless Nautilus is the command line. (n00b.) If so, I haven't tried that.

what other window managers are lightweight and featurefull other than xfce and fluxbox?
I like sawfish
I will check that out and maybe fluxbox....
what features are you after?
I like gnome, been on it for two years, but I want something with good features but is lightweight, maybe I will try xfce for a while
I have tried xfwm inside gnome...I like this setup. I do not like metacity at all.  If you like gnome, then I wouldn't use sawfish by itself
u use that instead of GDM?
I don't use gdm
sawfish looks like early gnome!
So, why was I able to upgrade to 11.04?. I upgraded to 10.10 from the previous LTS and it basically broke and initramfs failed to upgrade and then it said it was doing a recovery roll-back. And now it reports I'm using 11.04. It even says "You're using 11.04 relweased in April 2011"
that is a bug in 10.10 what does lsb_release -a say?
10.10, yet the upgrade to 10.10 failed and it did a roll back. is lsb release -a the guaranteed version I'm at?. or is it just some indicating file somewhere?
looking for a utilty that can show available wirefi networks, perhaps save & configure profiles for them, any syggestions?
are speaking of a network manager?
sure
look at wifi-tools or there is a network manager you can install for gnome
I'm not showing a wifi-tools package, do you know the name of the GNOME manager?
it might be network-manager
the gnome network-manager doesn't support wifi networks
Hi, I'd be glad if someone could help me. My problem is wubi broke, and since I can't figure out how to fix it I figure I'll just reformat and install it correctly. Is it possible to copy all of the files to an external, and then replace the ones on the fresh install and it would be just like before? Thanks in advance
why do you not have the data backed up?.  as in, already backed up?
No, not already backed up. I would plan on booting from a live cd and transfering to an external drive
But why is it not already backed up now?
I didn't know I was supposed to back it up regularly.. Nor did I know how.
if your drive motor fails and the drive doesn't spin up, where is your data?.  if you can copy data to a USB drive, you can backup
Well it doesn't have anything that important, I just don't want to have to setup apache and etc again.
you can mount the wubi image from the ubuntu live CD.
So, just going in and copying it all and then pasting on a fresh install will restore everything?
hi, any filezilla users here? I have problems connecting to a server, and I suspect filezilla tries to use FTP <unconvertable> rather than SFTP... how can I make sure it uses sftp?
Go to the site manager and configure it to SFTP ther.. there.*
what do you mean by "site manager"? is it a setting in filezilla?
Why am I getting a no installable kernel waf foun in the defined APT sources error?. during install that is. Can i install without a kernel or is that really hard?
the kernel is the core of the os and handles drivers etc, you need one there working
why can't I get it off the CD then?
you using the server/alternate install cd?
using alternate. Should I try live?
do you have networking setup and the internet working?
I didnt get network working. Is that important?
well if you had networking setup it may be getting that of the internet, or it may allow you to download one during install
I think it's a hardware thing, and the installer cant find my network device. Any other way?
perhaps the live cd may be easier, but you could potentially download this file off the internet and copy it to that computer
is it possible to install it on a flash?
well it seems like just the kernel package is messed up, you could potentially just copy this over to the computer running the install but it might be too much bother if you don't know what you are doing, your cd may have problems or your cd drive
I've checked both CD, md5 and memory. Still possible it's a hardware thing? The compy is pretty new.
Can anyone here help me get direct rendering enabled...?. Anyone?. :(. Any takers on Direct Rendering?

if you can swing a firewire 800 card and a firewire 800 drive, that would be nice. no i type reb then press <tab> and it auto-completes it. 
oh, a firewire pcmcia card? I have the 1394 built in. by morse code. =p
firewire 800 is rather new
sounds fast.. kinda like a firewire II?
the firewire you got is most likely firewire 400
yup... I don't know if I can boot to pcmcia, there is a removable media option in the boot order, however, 
yes
OUCH, firewire 800 HD 80gb,, hold on to your redHat, 292.30$
oh yea, its quite expensive

how about 5400?
only 20$ more.  worth it
its worth it

my sound stopped working correctly tonight, now instead of playing any sound it only crackles. i tried reloading alsa multiple times to no avail, i have no idea what to do, or what caused it
in the "System...Preferences...Sound..." menu, select different sources and test. See if that corrects it.
i tired them all, the only thing that makes any sound at all is "automatic" but it just crackles
Not insulting intelligence, but when I have problems I re-insert the physical connections and check the wires.
actually OSS makes a loud beeping sound.  but how can i figure out and fix whatever is wrong with alsa?
also did you install anything recently. I've had programs trash out sound configuration.
only thing i've been working on tonight is getting my svideo out to the tv working, which required me to uninstall and reinstall a bunch of fglrx stuff a few times, and restore some default config files, is it possible that it's something in xorg.conf?
one other thing. Right-click the sound icon on the task bar. And in volume control and preferences make sure the right channel is selected.
i think the right channel was selected but either way it makes the crackling sound with any playback channel
ok so the only failing point in this plan is the installing of the list
so now I have the command "dpgk --set-selection" to set my selection from the file, but I need to install it know as well!
right!. more research XD
so: how do I do that?
i'll see if i can figure that out for you standby
Google Chrome uses webkit, and so I guess they have to port that to Linux to?

not yet.. I'm using 3.16 utopic kernel in 14.04.. seems 3.16.0-55 now has a massive value for kernel.shmmax?
how are you checking it? i can boot a 14.04 VM with 3.19 and compare

I'm pretty sure I said the same thing back then. So why aren't you believing me?
just wait for a check
I want to list all files and folders in another folder. How do I do this? ls -??
depends what parameters you want to use but i use ls -lah /path/to/file
that only lists the folders, not what's in them
i keep getting this problem when attempting to compile:. "make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.. ". what should i do?. make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.. i can't compile rTorrent

the install file simply told me to make after ./configuring

hm.  and the versions? :)
good question... do you mean they are newer on Hoary and not yet translated ?
I have a permissions issue with dvd's on a new ubuntu install. /dev/cdrom0 and cdrom1 are both root:root, but are links to /dev/sr0 and sr1 respectively. sr0 and sr1 are root:cdrom. I am a member of the cdrom group.... but I can only play dvds if I use "sudo totem dvd://" from the command line.. launching as my regular user says I don't have permission to the dvd.
what group owns /dev/sr*
cdrom. @ cdrom
and /dev/sr* are links to /dev/cdr* correct
negative, cdrom0 and cdrom1 are links to sr*. this is a fresh install, btw, I've not played with it at all
thought i said that, must have misprinted.  said it backwards but so far things are good
right....I didn't want to change the permissions because I figured that was on purpose.. I'm even part of the cdrom group as my user

Nobody answers my questions in here :(
what was the question?.  re X?
I just did a dist-upgrade and X starts with a grey screen and a cursor but no window manager starts
are you using gnome?
fvwm
are you on another computer now?
No I'm in a virtual console using irssi
ok. the way to do it for now is to type (from a virtual console) "xterm --display :0". then go to the display.  and type fvwm-session
It says it can't open because DISPLAY is not set
oops, xterm -display :0.  anything?
One sec.  I got the xterm...but fvwm-session doesn't exist
i don't have fvwm, but try pressing fvwm[tab] and tell me which programs you see.  might wanna try just 'fvwm'
A lot....fvwm, fvwm2, fvwm-config, fvwm-root....some more
try fvwm2-session.  or just fvwm / fvwm2
No fvwm2-session, just fvwm2
try that
It says another WM is running and to try -replace.  when i try fvwm -replace X dies
do you have any wm's running?
Not that I can see...It just looks like X with a white arrow cursor and a grey background...nothing else
try (from virtual terminal) 'sudo killall X & sudo killall gdm'.  then from virtual terminal try "X :0 & xterm -display :0 & fvwm2".  have you tried doing just a 'startx'?
No processes killed.  Doing startx is how I got X in the first place, otherwise there is just console
try "X :0 & xterm -display :0 & fvwm2". oops.  skip the &fvwm part, put that in xterm.  pretty much same as before, but with a fresh X
Worked! :-D

make sure the input mici thingy is not muted in volume control
where's this volume control?
i dunno..mine is on my taskbar beside my clock and load meters...
well mine apperently isnt =(.  no it isnt muted
right click an empty spot on your taskbar, click "add to panel" and it'll bring up a little menu of mini apps to put on your taskbar..select the volume control one. have it plugged into the right hole?
there is only one card there that supports a mic, and it is not muted

HoN hangs, visually, so I have to kill -9 it. Then when I try to start it again it takes a long time (3x from functional) to start and just hangs immediately. Any ideas on how to fix it?. I use bumblebee.
have you checked the wine appdb for compatibility?
HoN is native.
do you run it with the exta command to make it use the nvidia gpu?
Yes.
have you tried it without?.  have you tried in a different session, like xfce etc?
http://paste.ubuntu.com/5604947/
try install xfce4, reboot then log into the xfce session. Is it better?
I'm in Blackbox now. No difference.
all I can suggest is report a bug. I have seen few success stories with switching GPU
It used to work fine.
there is a present bug though. right?
HoN works fine without bumblebee..  Yes, so?

What are Ubuntu users using to sort their data for XMBC?
clarify that question a bit.
I'm using XBMC on Ubuntu and I want XBMC to be able to recognize my media (TV Shows) a little better. There are third party apps that will do this on Windows, I'm wondering what Ubuntu users should use.
cant say that ive ever noticed any. I rarely use xbmc except to try it out every so often. The tool just has to many odd quirks. ;)
So you just use MPlayer. Man, you are missing out.
since upgrading to ubuntu 11.10 for reason my internet doesnt work without typing dhclient eth0 after boot.. how do I configure it so it works automatically?
have you tried editing the connection in the network manager applet?
I cant see the applet.. I am running xfce
is network manager installed?
umm I am not sure.. how do I tell ?
try "locate network-manager" at the command line and see if you get any files
basically I have just installed xfce cos I hated the new gnome and unity.. and gnome classic is just not supported.. so I went for xfce but now I don't have any of the applets etc.  yeah I get plenty of files from that command
there is a configuration file /etc/init/network-manager.conf, if that is not installed edit /etc/network/interfaces
yeah.  but with me using xfce.. should I uninstall this and install a xfce applet?
where would you install a php library that would be shared across all virtual host? (ie: Doctrine, Zend Framework, Cake Php)

If a device is listed in lspci (0000:01:02.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications, Inc. AR5212 802.11abg NIC (rev 01). ack. sorry.. lemme finish my thought. If a device is listed in lspci (0000:01:02.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications, Inc. AR5212 802.11abg NIC (rev 01)) how can I track down what it's called in /dev?
try iwconfig
I'm asking because it's actually not a device known to the system it's not listed in interfaces and iwconfig doesn't see it. I don't know how to "enable" it
looks like an atheros wlan card. i think you need to install restricted modules to get the drivers.
is there a restricted modules for ubuntu server?. I can't find one for linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15-25-server
I have a problem getting my apache server working on the internet. I can access it on localhost and through lan, but not outside.
Did you forward everything that comes in on port 80 to your webserver ?
- yes, i do. Through my router
Try connecting your computer directly to the internet.  If you are able to connect via LAN, it seems like a router mis-configuration
- can't. i have a combined router/modem.  - well, i did exactly as when i configured my ssh, and that worked
Okay. What do a "traceroute <host>" show ? (pastebin, please).  From outside your network
- i don't have any machines outside my network.
Ah, that's why! :).  You have to enable a special feature in your router if you are trying to access your server from within your network on a public IP / domain.  What's your domian/IP ?
- www.moppa.se
Hm, no. That dosn't work.  What's the IP ?
- or hackback.servebeer.com
Maybe you misconfigured DNS
- 213.64.134.153
Okay, looks right - weird..
- you are not getting any webpage served, right?
But again, the webserver is accessible through LAN ?.  Nope, no web page is being displayed
- yes
And 213.64.134.153 is YOUR ip, right ? Not some redirector, dyndns or what ever
- Nope, that's the ip to my router.
what is the default runlevel? or wat is # in "telinit #" to return to normal mode?. clue: # is something between 2 - 5. well... based on wikipedia... im thinking it is 3?. or 5?. upddate: telinit 5 got lightdm login back... but no consoles seem avaiable with F1-F5.
Ubuntu doesn't have runlevels...
what is the alternative i should research? to get it into single user mode?
one more question will this allow me to see all those video online that i couldn't see?
most videos online are in flash
not all them. only youtube stuff can i see
and I thing the "restricted extras" comes with the flash plugin
ok, well anyway ty
but the quick answer should be "yes, you should"
goodbye. ok, thanks. i really appreciate your help nino

why would a network interface not be able to access internal lan addresses?
is the nic set as the DMZ?
good question. How do I check?.  this nic would be my broadcom wireless
if you haven't set it up as dmz, it's probably not dmz.
that's what I was thinking ;).  nonetheless, is there any iptables madness I need to be messing with or something? Why would my wire connection not have this problem?
so this is your wireless nic? is it working with the internet, but not LAN?
exactly. I'm on the wireless nic right now, but I can't access any other computer on teh network

when I create a zip file, it adds a folder in the zip file called "home" containing the directory structure to the files in the zip, how can I prevent this?
how do you create the zip file?
right-click on a selection of files and choose "create archive" in menu (Thunar, I think). yes the file manager is Thunar
can you show an example with a screenshot? you could upload it to imgur.com
http://imgur.com/YDKSBHI
and the 'home' directory inside the zip contains what?
the directory structure leading to the files you see below, which in this case is /home/me/Desktop/test.zip
hmm, are you running file-roller (the archiving utility) as root there? that's maybe not a good idea. i would recommend to resort to the comand line for this purpose..  which ubuntu release is this? lsb_release -ds
not as root afaik.  Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
hey guys I wanna format my PC and reinstall Ubuntu except my CD drive is out. All the tutorials I find on Google explain how to do it from a Windows machine except I don't have a Windows machine (I use Ubuntu already). Can anyone show me an easy tutorial on how to do that ?
do you have a USB drive (pen drive/stick)? you could use it in lieu of a CD drive
yes I do. But I can't seem to boot from it
having a problem where I setup a PXE folder, but I want to delete it and put something else in it's place but i'm not allowed to delete it even as root ?
explain more
I ran this earlier as root : chroot /miners/1 mount /proc.  what is the proper way to unmount this so I can delete it
reboot would be easy
k trying that.  that worked :-D
Does anyone have any experience with Deja Dup?
I have some experiences with it, yes.
I'm trying to restore a backup, but it seems to have gotten stuck on "checking for backups"... Either that or I'm being impatient
Hmm. Run htop, see if it's acting up..  This never occured to me. It's very straightforward app.
'htop'?
htop, or Run "ps -aux | grep deja" -- Whatever the dejadup command is.
Ok... What am I looking for?
See if RAM or CPU is really high, that's it..  Are you trying to restore a large backup? If so, that may be the reason.
Doesn't seem so, no
How long have it been?
I'd say... about 25 minutes
Okay. Clearly something happened. It shouldn't really take that long. Different versions?
Nope, same version. I just did a reinstall
Meh. Can't say much. It's dead simple for me. Create. Restore. That's it.
Strange.... I'm also attempting to do it over the network, maybe that's why?
Ah. I never did it. I create it on the machine. Scp over the files..  Also, I like the last comment. http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dj-dup-perfect-linux-backup-software/
That was... Informative...

does ubuntu have an ima server for checksums ?

integrity management archatecture. does remote checksums to make sure system is as it should be
maybe that's "integrity measurement architecture"?
yes
ok guys and gals, after using synaptic package manager to install openssh-server. how do I start it?

Could anybody tell me why disabling journalling to save SSD writes is a bad idea?
thats seems perfectly reasonable if that is your concern
having three VM's with EXT4, yes it does. Can i disable it w/out having to use EXT2 ?
the distinction between ext2/3/4 is not a bright line..  its perfectly valid to say ext4-journalling is ext3-journaling+extents or ext2+extents.  to focus only on the high level features
however if i keep using EXT4 i would still have the beneficts of SSD compatibility, such as trim. So can i just get rid of journalling w/out too many drawbacks?
if you disable the journal then you are disabling journaling
is it something that i write on /etc/fstab, right?
etunefs
since you certainly are more wise than me, if having too many SSD write rates concerns me, would it be a good idea to disable it?
How can I get 64bit flash to work in google chrome?
I'd just get the libflashplayer.so and dump it at /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins.  I know chrome/opera/ff use that folder to load plugins
did that... it's not picking it up for some strange reason.. well, ~/.mozilla/plugins and /usr/lib/flash-addons/plugins. Didn't try yours. Moment then.
what about other browser? like Opera? not trying to push you to it, just wondering if it's a chrome setting, rather than not reading it
firefox isn't working as well
Please, anyone?
whats wrong?

after I alter the blacklist, I need to reboot?. Ubuntu on a macbook rocks.. thats what I am using now.. GREAT support.. After I alter the modules blacklist.. do I need to reboot??
no
then what do I do to stop that module now?
sudo modprobe -r <module name>
cant, that causes my system to lockup and crash.
I have an issue with upgrade. Your current Hardware Enablement Stack (HWE) is going out of support. on 08/07/14.. i ran the necessary provided update command and it crashed. E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

i cant mount my cd or dvd drives, can anyone help me?
Just swing yer legs over them and yer done. But seriously, *why* can't you mount them? what happens when you put a CD in etc?
i put the disc in, and it does nothing, double clicking on the drive brings up an error.  "mount: special device /dev/scd1 does not exis"
... which is what
same with the other drive, but scd0 instead
ok - thats the useful bit. I can't find the interface I was expecting that could help - gimme a few minutes
ok, thanks.  just so you know, the drives both work under a windows partition on the same machine
is there a way to restart my DVD drive in terminal since it seems not to be working?. is there a way to restart my DVD drive in terminal since it seems not to be working?
yea but its not safe
why not since I need to burn this through tovid but it seems whenever I try to open it, it just doesnt respond
well a reboot would suffice if the DVD drive works after reboot but he othe way is unsafe
I was hoping you would tell me the command I really would prefer doing it through terminal instead of rebooting
well maybe doing "hdparm -w
what do you mean by maybe.... are you sure that is a restarting command
rpm.......
Lies..  Ubuntu doesn't support rpm
NO SHIT. RED HAT PACKAGE MANAGER. just kiddin man, thought it was a joke question there THE ADMIN
hey can someone explain to me why when I run "mget somedirectory" it says no file or directory?????
Directory is not a file in the ftp sense, I think, try using directory/* instead on just cd directory and them mget *
I read that mget is not for getting directories anyways.  and that you should tar it first
tar it first? What's the 'it' in this? (note, I have no more context than your question above)
the ftp man :P
you do not need to tar ftp. Nor to tar the files on the server to get them with mget
when I do what you say it does this: mget forums/memberlist.php? y. local: forums/memberlist.php: No such file or directory
But I probably still do not know what you meant with 'tar it' so maybe I'll just stop trying to help and let someone elso do it
well I just did mget *. and got that

lsmod
yea i tried that but the sound card is not showing
does it show with lspci?.  or sudo lshw?
yes i see hardware but no audigy/creative. . . still showing my onboard sound though.  i wonder if its just not getting loaded and have to do something with the modules
you disabled onboard and put in audigy?
yes
is card seated correctly?
yea, when i started ubuntu it showed that it detected a new module for a split second.  like on boot up, showed a new device before loading ubuntu.  should it just work out of the box or am i missing something?
type alsamixer in terminal which card is listed in top left corner?

I have it installed however I CAN NOT GET the nvidia driver installed. I actually just got done doing all the updates on a fresh install of 8.10 (8th time reinstalling). Every time I try to enable the nvidia drivers and reboot I get welcomed with a Black screen letting me know it cant startx
System -> Administration -> Hardware drivers. Oh right.  ehm. So the actual config does not work?
if I activate one of those drivers (even the reccomended ones) and reboot I cant startx
I see... Ehm. Did you try sudo nvidia-xconfig before logging out?
no, but I did run it once I couldnt startx. it reconfig'd my xorg file however it still couldnt startx
And what did it output?
wizzup: the xorg file?
No, nvidia-xconfig. Did it say it was succesful?
wizzup: let me activate the driver and sudo run the config. I'll tell you extactly. Worst case I just reinstall for a9th time
I am sure you can disable the drivers without reinstalling
Well I'm not that good with linux to know what to do without a gui.  so I just reinstall. Prolly faster to spend 15 mins reinstalling then poke around tryin to startx without the driver again
There is probably an easy way. I'd tell you to google how to deactivate them, but meh.
alright, going to activate and sudo nvidia-xconfig. 1 sec
Let's pray.  You might also want to nvidia-settings before logging out. see if it states that you have to enable it
lucky number 8 eh?
:p
k activated and ran nvidia-xconfig. Output some warnings about "No layout specified constructing implicit layout section using screen defualt screen" and "Unable to find corepointer in X configuration, attempting to add new corepointer section"
Just a sec
it says it created a new x configuration file
That should be good then
k here goes a reboot

sorry on the ubuntu nbr site. there is a link called "popluar models" in the text. is there a #eeebuntu somewhere?
thanks for the pointer. I've taken a look. the only issue listed is to do with sound performance with pulseaudio, but I've already taken that off to fix another problem. sorry, microphone stuttering

Sara22: there's a realtek wireless chipset in there. Sara22: you need to use ndiswrapper
thanks . but I have no idea how to set it up i am new.  i just converted from vista. I have no idea what it means to use ndiswrapper
Sara22: no problem! ndiswrapper is a little piece of software that allows one to use certain windows drivers under linux. Sara22: are you familiar with the Terminal?
yes :)
Sara22: super! ok, pop one open and type 'sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper ndisgtk'
it says couldn't find package ndiswrapper
Sara22: sorry! using old package names just use 'sudo apt-get install ndisgtk'. Sara22: that will handle the dependency (ndiswrapper itself, which is split into two packages)
ok done!
sweet! now we need the windows (so called 'ndis') driver.
who do I get that?
Sara22: I'm just trying to hunt one down for you; and it seems that there might've been a native linux driver made recently
thank you!
Sara22: from realtek's website; if i'm not mistaken, that gateway should have a realtek 8187B chipset. you can check by typing 'dmesg | grep -i Realtek'. or 'lspci | grep -i realtek'
So Ubuntus kernel doesn't support that by default?
...and
just asking
that does it. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mountall/+bug/599624. I can't see one good reason why I should even keep upstart or mountall anymore. it now yields to me zero benefit over sysvinit
it sounds like a bug, i'm just wondering how you came to notice it since full filesystem checks are infrequent, and the chances of this causing a noticable slowdown seem infrequent.
touch /forcefsck. what would it take to bring back sysvinit
/forcefsck is not an everyday occurance. For normal filesystems with staggered check intervals, no one would notice. (that said, it is still a bug)
until your uptime exceeds the check intervals
that is the one thing missing from your bug report. the impact. it is unclear how much time is "lost" from checking the partitions simultaneously instead of searially. [i agree this is a bug btw]
5x
but how much actual time is that
who cares, I'm probably about to replace the entire boot sequence anyway
because 2 minutes every 3 months is slightly annoying at most.
what's annoying is the obvious incompetance of the developers. in trying to squeeze a few extra seconds they demonstrated they do not understand unix

perhaps you can start up another OS just to get CD support, then run Ubuntu intall?

hmmm. won't let me CTRL ATL F+ANYTHING. :( I'm trying to add the '3' thingy to the kernal at bootup if that makes any sense. But that didn't work either

hi all! i want to send smtp through gmail from my web server. i found this tutorial: http://behindmyscreen.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/31/501615-configuringubuntu-postfix-and-gmail-in-101-easy-steps on how to do that with postfix, but was shocked at how complicated it was. is there a simpler way?
ssmtp is what it says, simple smtp if you only need to load it off to gmail
but will it work with all the encryption handshake mumbo-jumbo that you have to do when connecting to gmail?
yes; starttls/ssl, the works, and extremely leightweight as well.  it's not a full blown MTA though, if that's what you need
thanks! i'm going to ask you again when things screw up though :)

Good Evening, I'm new so let me apologize if the answer to this question is obvious and I have missed it. I would like to make my windows machine a dual boot. The problem is both disks are currently formated at NTFS and set to one big partition each. Can the installer resize these without losing data and from there what will I need to do to get both bootable if they are both on different hard disks. Thanks
If you are currently using both disks in windows, you can move everything to C: and use the other disk for Ubuntu.  or backup everything and reinstall windows and all your programs to one disk and delete the windows partitions on the second disk. then install Ubuntu or what ever on the second disk..  During the install of Ubuntu, it will automatically detect the windows partition and give you the choice of booting into windows or ubuntu when the computer starts up.
That would be easy except the disks are vastly different in size (120gb vs 1.5tb) and my windows os is on the smaller one. The problem with backing up and reinstalling is mostly one of time. I was really hoping to avoid that.  sorry I got behind a bit so one the second part you are saying it should handle the detection of both OS I just want to confirm that this will work with each OS on seperate disks

hi guys. my wireless keeps disconnecting and i cant figure out why. ubuntu server 10.10. i also just installed ubuntu-desktop as i read this sometimes helps.... no dice :(. it's perpetually connecting and disconnecting.. and moving very very slow.. anyone?
what's your setup?
10.10 server. just installed ubuntu-dekstop hoping it would help. same result as terminal though. connections are made and dropped. huge packet loss. what else. wpa2.. ive got wpa_supplicant configured... although im not sure it's totally correct..  also, it's a sony vaio laptop. i had this working perfectly the otherday.. then i did a reformat and havent been able to get it working since.
did you check to ensure your wireless card is on the list of compatible cards.
i havent checked. but it does work.
are you sure it's your card? How's the access point?
iwconfig shows the macaddress for the router.
you can try shutting down your networking card and booting it back up again "/etc/init.d/networking stop | start" and "/etc/init.d/wicd start | stop
link quality is only 47/70.. but that shouldnt make this kind of diference.  sudo /etc/init.d/networking stop returned the following.. "postconf: fatal: .etc.postfix/main.cfg no suck file dir along with RTNETLINK answers :No such process and SIODELRT :no such process

Hi everyone, I have a problem with my ubuntu, its freshly installed last night, got XGL working but im not using it right now, im on regular gnome. Problem is when I load any game it goes fine very 5 seconds, then it stalls for about 3 and goes fine again for a few more seconds, its a cycle like this
have you monitored the disk access, memory and cpu ?
Yeap, processor usage remains at 2.50 max
when you did a fresh install did you select the restricted modules for your proprietary opengl support DRI etc...  I'm wondering if its your videocard trying to run opengl with vesa or non-dri drivers

Hi, sometimes when i turn up my laptop gives me popups that it cannot write certain files, I used to fsck via recovery mode and then everything worked fine until the next restart, but not it is not working. I dual boot with windows 7 and currently i am writing from it. How to fix this ? Thank you in advance.
which files?
almost every file now, can't open home direcotry, no wireless, no google chrome just popups flooding
does dmesg say anythong about remounting filesystems readonly after errors?
i keep getting this error for 5 weeks, but it used to fix just with fsck, now nothing works, i reinstalled many times and get this error but not with windows, It used to work fine with ubuntu couple months ago though
if your filesystem breaks this often: make a backup and buy a new disk
but not for windows ?

pasted var/sys/log thingy here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31123/ if that helps at all ?
well that is the device, I don't know why it isn't mounting, is there anything in it. Generally it automounts. If it didn't automount, it likely doesn't recognize whatever you put in it so it won't mount manually
its a q3 arena cd but *sob*. light doesnt even go on
those other mountpoints you tried aren't specified in the file either. Not that this would work but the mount point ought to be, according to the fstab, /media/cdrom0
same thing about special device not existing

whats the best way to format a second harddrive? i used "dd ..." to wipe out the harddrive, then followed the directions on this website [http://www.idevelopment.info/data/Unix/Linux/LINUX_PartitioningandFormattingSecondHardDrive_ext3.shtml] by using "fdisk" and "mke2fs ..." After I mounted "/dev/hdb1", it shows 2.1 GB of a 80 GB drive....
try gparted instead of fdisk sounds like you made a small parition
so im supposed to use "dd" then gparted, then mke2fs....then mount?

I am trying to reset my localhost mysql root password. When I start the mysqld via systemd the socket file is created fine in /var/run/mysql but if I launch mysqld_safe manually it errors out do I need to manually make /var/run/mysql ?
@ Does it work when you connect via tcp/ip or is networking disabled?
its a local mysqld so networking shouldnt matter
@ Well, if it is not listening on a file socket, maybe you can connect via TCP/IP - `mysql -h 127.0.0.1` is your friend
If I so "systemctl start mysql.service" the socket file is created and all is well if I top the service via "systemctl stop mysql.service" and then relaunch it in a root shell (sudo -i) it fails even as root to create the socket file it errors out like this http://paste.opensuse.org/view/raw/71bdfb36

Does anyone know why sticking wiz ALL = NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/personal-script under root in "sudo visudo" still asks for a password when i do sudo /etc/init.d/personal-script restart. ?
your system is not in an aceptable state.  as I told you earlier.  1.) you should not be logged in as root 2.) you should have a non-privileged user 3.) you have no need to use sudo as root
not acceptable? that's the logical explanation why my user who is in sudoers doesn't work?. I am logged in as a personal user that is in sudoers file
you just said you are root
no i'm not, at least not now
you said you where root a few lines up
under root meaning under the line in visudo
please show me the output of the command "id"
under the line that defines nopasswd for root. uid=1000(wiz) gid=1000(wiz) groups=1000(wiz),27(sudo),119(openerp)
can you show me your full sudo line please.
yes sure .  this is after it failed to work just for that script and tried the wildcard :http://pastie.org/8276504

hi guys! when I watch divx videos the quality is really bad - anyone knows a solution?
What video player you using?
vlc
Also, are you certain that the video quality itself is bad ?
well, the thing is that the quality is better when I run beryl or compiz
Never used vlc...
but in the normal gnome session the quality is just bad. however, under beryl/compiz the colors are messed up
Again, are you sure the video ITSELF the quality isn't bad ?
yes, I'm sure

Arafangion, are you sure you burned it as an iso. Arafangion, sorry, bad completion.  are you sure you burned it as an iso, not a data disk?
I just used the Windows burner thing.  can you suggest a good program?.  preferrably free
try mounting the disk in windows; if all you see is one file, you burned it wrong
if i want to exclude certain files from my archive, how can i say that in the cli?. a regular expression i guess saying ''all files in this folder except those with filenames including 'pattern'''
what kind of archive?
tar -cvvzf. gzip. gzipped tar*
--exclude=/proc
the regular expression is what i need i think
is there a way to search in nano?
Yes, Ctrl+W

no
Could you enlighten me? ^^
chmod -R permissions /folder/
where does the spesific group get involved in those permissions?. afaik that command only sets global permissions on that folder?
you do chgrp -R group /folder/

The X windows system cannot start,
check that portmap is running. `rpcinfo -p`. I meant check that portmap is running on the client.
it is, that was output from the client.
oh, why is your client running mountd,nfs,and status? that is not necessary.
because I tried to get nfs to work.. still doesn't.
from the client run `rpcinfo -p <server>`
it just sits there, no output
That is your problem, your server is not responding to portmap requests from the client. firewall??
no firewall :/
try running `rpcinfo -p` on the server.
I get portmapper, status, nfs, nlockmgr, mountd
run `sudo tcpdump port 111` on the client, then in another window run `rpcinfo -p <server>`.. You should see traffic going in both directions.
yeah I did. I did see traffic with tcpdump, but rcpinfo just said nothing. still can't mount, this is strnage
did you see replies from the server? or just the requests?
both. 17:16:00.635766 IP fackamato.830 > www.tehjunkyard.net.sunrpc: S 1729540802:1729540802(0) win 5840 <mss 1460>. 17:16:00.635968 IP www.tehjunkyard.net.sunrpc > fackamato.830: S 1349580188:1349580188(0) ack 1729540803 win 5840 <mss 1460>. 17:16:03.636027 IP fackamato.830 > www.tehjunkyard.net.sunrpc: S 1729540802:1729540802(0) win 5840 <mss 1460>. 17:16:03.636276 IP www.tehjunkyard.net.sunrpc > fackamato.830: S 1352580076:1352580076(0) ack 1729540803 win 5840 <mss 1460>

hey guys and gals i have a problem with my / it seems to be reporting 0 space available when i know for a fact there are about 2 gigs free. I was recently accessing it and writing files to it with ext2fsd under windows and now it reports 0 disk space available (this problem does not occur under windows). i tried touch /forcefsck and rebooted but the problem persists. root@ubuntu:/home/daishi# df /. Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on. /dev/hda5 63196008 61017852 0 100% /
5% is being used by root.  df will put that in account as well
what?. what do u mean by that
5% of filesystem space is reserved by root to use for emergencies among other things
Ohh I guess ext2fsd doesnt take that into account. but its still weird because i had the 2gbs free before using ext2fsd. ohh wait. nevermind.  thanks for your help

Question -> Need help on getting PCI-e (gforce 8600GTS) working on ubuntu. (Currently onboard video is enabled and works with ubuntu). lspci command shows device is detected (gforce8600). need help on getting onboard + pci-e working at the same time in xorg. (checked forums but results are only for dual-screen setup and/or multiple nvidia+ati cards setup).. livecd boots (spins up and shows activity) shows blank screen if i only try to hookup the pci-e card. if i disable onboard on bios same thing happens. so currently i told the bios to load onboard as primary display. (so i got ubuntu up now but in failsafe mode). i was willing to load the livecd to do fresh install, but i can't get any signal with the pci-e nvidia gforce 8600. (just a blank screen). so i'm left with onboard working and pci-e card is detected but not configured.
if you install it, you can configure it later to use the other pci-e card, I think. *the pci-e card
skiessi -> ya its installed and booted with onboard right now. lspci detects the card but i am getting trouble configuring it..  - i had restricted drivers in use.. before i poped the card in. i was able to use nvidia-settings .
you got my pms?
no

hi guys, i'm new to ubuntu and linux and I have a noob question regarding file/folder permissions

I am trying to learn Joomla and have successfully installed LAMP on my VirtualBox under Win7. so far so god. now I followed a tutorial how to do that. and my Joomla is installed to var/www/. now I want to work on a tutorial on how to make a joomla template from scratch. and it starts out: "make a new folder in your joomla template directory". but I cannot do that
how are you trying to do it?
I go to the folder var/www/joomla/templates and right click, like i would do it in windows. should I use the terminal and sudo mkdir?
that would be the way I would do it :)
ok cool thanks :). so one more question about this..
yea
linux as a standard has disabled file permissions on any other than the usr folder. which is good and I understand that. to keep the sys clean. but why would I break from this rule here?
my c-a-t to open a terminal stopped working. PrtSc stopped doing print screens too. super key still brings up the expected search thing. where are those keys defined?
you could search in System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts
thanks.
np
I see "Launch Terminal ... Ctrl+Alt+T" and yet that doesn't do anything.
you can change it ... press the line with you mouse, and in the same time press ctrl+a for example
I am more interested in making the current setting work.
!info nouveau-kernel-source. is that the source for 2.6.30?
there's a ppa for 2.6.30
i am trying to get the kernel source to install Nvidia drivers, ive done this on fedora before just not ubuntu, i installed linux-kernel-source but that says its for 2.6.28 kernel
oh dear.  ok you install the Nivida drivers from the Ubuntu repo, and "only" as a last resort, if you got some problem, the offical Nivida drivers from their website, otherwise your bound to get problems
ah
system > administaration > hardware drivers, there should be the repo one available
i thought the official ones would be better

wifi
what kind of wireless card do you have? (do you know how to find out?)
wifi.  no i dont.  i do know it was working on my 8.04
run this command: sudo lspci -k (and pastebin the output) Do you know how to pastebin?.  If it worked on 8.04 I am very confident I can get it working on 10.10
i cant pastebin the output cause that comp isnt connected
Then read it and tell me what it says (look for the bit about your wifi) I think you can figure it out even though it's a lot of output..  I'm looking for something like this Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 (with a different number there)
http://pastebin.com/f9zsJzUz
liar! :D.  You have BCM4312 Do you see it there?
yes i see it now.  i dont know what that means though.  but i still cant enable my wireless
It's basically the model of the wifi chip. It lets me know which driver to use. (the b43 driver). I can also see that the b43 driver is already being used on the card. Can you tell me what 'sudo iwlist scan' does?.  I know, still just info finding. run that command: sudo iwlist scan.  that command tests if it is working
new. edib

make it mount on media (edit fstab).  make it mount on /media/ (edit fstab)
mind going in with some more detailed information?
if you create a mount point for it under /media/ it will show up on the desktop
i got a folder on it that i want to be loaded as the Desktop folder for my user :/.  not just mount it to media everytime
you have to add it to /etc/fstab so it mount automatically on each boot.  make ~/Desktop be a symbolic link to the folder you want
aah i understand now :P

yeah I think the man page descibes it. it has classes you can modify in .Xresources I believe
ok. thx
I refuse to use anything but aterm or urxvt in any wm though
xterm is too small and u cant copy/paste
you can copy paste and change font/windows size in xterm.  however I find urxvt far superior
where can i get that, its not in apt sources
just mark the text you wanna copy then press the middle button or both of you don't have one to paste.  it is

Ah, I see. It seems rsync only sends files with different timestamps if the source timestamp is newer than the destination.. I need to also include source files that are older than destination. I need to also include source files that are older than destination, however, if I modify a file on the source, and then rsync, for some reason the file does not get reverted from the source to remove the modifications.. oops, mistyped msg. Bah, I was wrong. It does update files that are older and newer. However, if I modify a file on the source, and then rsync, for some reason the file does not get reverted from the source to remove the modifications.
you want mirroring, not the normal operation.  which is for backups. (if i had to guess)
https://pastebin.com/raw/7YUd26xG I am using -a option. I think it has to do with different timestamps than the times that appear in `ls -al /path/to/file` output.
so you want to change a file on the source and have rsync undo your changes?
yes
does the dest see the modification on the source?
What do you mean?. The source is left untouched. if I edit the source, then rsync syncs perfectly fine
what? you just said "if i modify a file on the source"
but if I edit the destination (e.g. edit text file with vi and save) and then rsync again, the change is not detected.

ah, dowloading torrents in ubuntu is very complicated :-(
how? Just open the torrent file with transmission
transmission keeps pausing the downloads, i don't know why, and vizu says my files are too large
transmission is part of a default install. Windows users have to manually install a client making it harder than in Ubuntu.  what file system are you using to store your torrent files? Does it have free space?
i just formatted a 2TB external HDD with ext4
ok. What is the output of : lsb_release -a; df -i; uname -a; df -h
should i excecute this command in terminal?
use http://pastie.org or similar to host the text.  yes please
http://fpaste.org/174326/14221889/raw/
looks good. Are you settling the download to go to /media/theone/Films ?
yes
did you recursively chown the mount point to your user?
no, and i am not sure what that means,
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/theone.  so that your user is the owner of the data and can write to it.
hmmm, i am not sure what that means yet, :-( seems complicated.  and i still get the same error, file too large, i just tryed the torrent again
Ok I made a stripped volume on two SSDs on lvm2, but I am not sure it is now faster or not. Not sure how to test. Wit ' dd if=/dev/urandom of=testfileR bs=4k count=10000; sync;' the speed is the same 7,8 MB/s. With hdparm the Timing cached reads: is about the same 4257.12 MB/sec, but the Timing buffered disk reads is much faster on the lvm. sda:470 lvm:870 MB/sec. So will it be faster like this?. http://pastebin.com/LyEafJeB Here is how I was doing it
And whats the actual issue in one sentence?.  using your bs and count values, it implies (for a sane benchmark), that you have 40000k RAM only.
issue is that I am not sure that now it is faster.  if I made it right
First, you have to benchmark your disks, not your RAM, as you did.
now I am testing with dd if=/dev/zero of=./largefile bs=64k count=100000 and the result is 6553600000 bytes (6,6 GB) copied, 7,2175 s, 908 MB/s
why are you changing bs now?
against 3276800000 bytes (3,3 GB) copied, 7,82616 s, 419 MB/s so I thing I can be happy now :)
you are comparing cars and apple trees.
I dont know what I am doing then
Yeah, I told you what to do :).  use bs=4k and a count value that will result in a total data about 2x of your RAM.
ok
im back. !!. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16991/. there

Hi! I have got a question about Dapper freezing every once in while. It happens on my laptop and I saw people discussing it on ubuntuforums.org. Will the problem be solved for Edgy?
when does it freeze?
talisein:randomly :-/ sometimes when starting an app, sometimes when closing....  (sorry...): randomly :-/ sometimes when starting an app, sometimes when closing...
that's not good :-/
yep. Sorry to say that I cannot reproduce it - But it happened just an houre ago. Usually 1-2x a week...
time to buy new hardware ;-)
Why do you think so? The laptop (ThinkPad X31) is perhaps 3yo. And it never froze with Breezy while it has been freezing nearly a dozen times with Dapper.
I would suspect that changing hardware might increase system stability - but I believe you, my desktop system keyboard locks up once/day at precisely 1:06am every morning. Breezy was fine, but the problem started with my upgrade to Dapper :-(.  maybe our problems are related somehow? Do you have any good URLs on the problem?
Hm. And what about the people discussing the freezing problem on ubuntuforums? I feel I am not alone..  No, sorry. I read the forums and they said it might be the gfx driver. But who knows...

Is there a good reason openjdk-7-jre-headless does not provide default-jre-headless?
The dependency would go the otherway around. Ie default-jre-headless is a pointer that points to another jre-headless package.
default-jre-headless depends on openjdk-6-jre-headless. I do not want java6, just java7.
Well since java7 is not default then default-jre-headless will not provide it (I guess)
That sucks, because lots of things depend on default-jre-headless.
Hey, I am having a bit of trouble with my command line... i screwed something up a long time ago, and never bothered to fix it, but it is bugging me; whenever i start up my command line, it begins with the following text;. mkdir: cannot create directory `/dev/cgroup/cpu/user/7957': No such file or directory. bash: /dev/cgroup/cpu/user/7957/tasks: No such file or directory. any idea how i can fix that?
it means its not there
what's not there? it prints this message every time i start up the terminal
it means that dir doesnt exist
what directory?
/dev/cgroup/cpu/user/7957/tasks
i haven't typed anything yet when it prints this. so i should make it?
no. dont know why its saying that
neither do i :<
i dont know what you messed up before :s. a long time ago...
lol, i dont remember :s. i will try making the directory, to see what it does. who knows :p
it may get rid of the error. you might get a new one. either way, somethings wrong
i did it,  the error changed. it is now:. mkdir: cannot create directory `/dev/cgroup/cpu/user/8229': Permission denied. bash: /dev/cgroup/cpu/user/8229/tasks: No such file or directory

Jragon, DFP1 is the problem.  ** sorry.  Let me tell you a little about my setup, I have 3 x 23" Samsung P2370's two of which are on the DVI and one is on a mini display port (active) to DVI ,that is the that one I'm having problems with.
there are other suggestions on that wiki page from ubottu, what happens when you try them?
any in particular?
whatever works :) I have no experience with the setup you described, so we just have to try and see. This mini display port by the way is still from your ati card?
yeah.. HD 5970 two DVI, one mini display port.
also, do you know if ati provides some special program to configure things? I know nvidia does
it does of which I tried to use to solve with no luck, it's called ATI Catalyst Control Center.
ah
made some amendments, trying it out, if not rm -fr /media/ubuntu/. thanks for your willingness to help though.
hello everyone. I just saw someone's desktop and they have windows xp as a Virtual Machine on ubuntu...how can this be done? VMware charges you for using their software. Are there any free ones?. the xp virtual machine was not running inside another window yet on a 2nd desktop and the Start Menu was on the bottom just like Windows has it. How can this be accomplished?
call Microsoft and ask their wonderful support staff?
lol, i just need xp for visual basic programming
that's rediculous

hi, i run amarok and mplayer at the same time under xfce and when i tried to gain the volume in amarok, the sound suddenly turned off, and even after i restarted the box, it's still off. Any help???
in a terminal run to run alsamixer and see if things are muted or turned down. I suppose you could also doubleclick the speaker icon
tried, i turn everything but no use
turn off your speakers, unplug them, wait 10 seconds then plug them back in
.  ok.  still nothing
hmm..
???
run mplayer on whatever you did before and tell me what audio output method its using (alsa, esd, ...)
the output method is definitely alsa.  mplayer says "alsa-init: using device default"
hmm, so you do have a /dev/dsp right?
yep
does your sound card setup have a headphone out jack you can check?. !alsa>
no, i checked it all.  not that stupid :)

hey guys. i was wondering if you guys could help me with something. i have an SSH server setup...and i was wondering if you guy scould tell me how to get X forwarding to work. i am using puTTy to connect to my laptop right now if that helps with my question at all
you can't forward X unless you are running an X server on your local machine
my n00b bad
try installing cygwin
do i need cygwin on any windows boxes i use?. because i am setting this up more for my *at school use*
as far as i am aware you will have to run an X server on any machine you wish to forward X to
ok are there any Java based apps for that, that i can download?. java is the ONE thing my school cant take from me:)
the alternative would be to use vnc or nx
i see. i can stick with text terminals i guess:) those are more 1337 than VNC. and i dont want to open up anymore ports on my router
if you run nx you won't need to open any new ports
i wont? it will work through port 22?
(it uses ssh)
thats what i like to hear:) you get my attention when you say SSH:)
Sorry, for a noob question but, where is a good site to upload stuff ive created?

Hello everyone, I'm having a wireless problem with my dell studio 15. How would I go about to fixing it?. I've already installed NDIS wrapper, but I'm not sure which drive I should install ans where I should get it from, can someone help me find which driver to install?
what is your wireless adapter ?
how to I figure it out? I just got this computer recently. I've done lspci, and it's bcm4310. if that's what you mean
yeah, that's I mean :)
ok. so what do I do now?
well if you ude ndiswrapper, AFAIK, you can get use the drivers that windows would use
I've followed some instructions days ago, but none worked out
actually,I saw an auto-ndiswrapper app a while back that looks for the driver automatically, I will try to find it again, brb
ok, thank you
http://easylinuxwifi.org/
thanks, I'll try to install and I'll report back
awesome, I will be gone, but if could message me a quick message to tell me how that worked out, it would be great (I am curious about the competence of the auto-ndiswrapper).  but if you could *
I will be sure to
thanks :)
it said card is not yet supported
oy! sorry then, what instructions did you follow that didn't work ?
This one recently, because I didn't feel like dealing with NDIS, and the section with "wget", the file is not available http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=434946. and the one with NDIS is coming in a minute
can you use the ndiswrapper frontend ?
I'm not sure, but I'm fairly certain the reason it didn't work before was because I was using the wrong driver
you can install a GUI that will make ndiswrapper more painless (such as Ndisgtk or NdisConfig that I've used with success).  and then you can point ndiswrapper (via frontend) to the windows driver for your card
alright. cool, thanks.
:O Celestia for Linux (joy!)
yeah I love those apps
Stargazing is basically one of my largest pasttimes.
too much light pollution where I am at the mo :(
Same here but it's a passion.
so anyone know anything about power supplies? I had to change mine and my connector doesn't exactly match my old one or my motherboard. it's the really long one with the double line pins, the new one is like 4 pins shorter than the old one, can I still use it?
you may have another cable with the 4 pins on it floating off the power supply..
Yes, there is, however I thought it connected to another spot on the motherboard, as my old one had it there too
Hi. I want to monitor my internet connection download speed by downloading some data for a period of time, not a fixed size package. Anyone knows such tools? Not very related to ubuntu I realise now. Anyway I'm using ubuntu :D

sure that's good enough for watching, but I want to test it overnight
Are there any known performance issues with 10.04 over 9.10? I'm noticing a much higher average system load level after upgrading, with nothing else really changing on my server.. In fact, it went up 10-fold. My average system load used to be 0.03, now it's 0.3
what u see in top?
Xorg and compiz

should I try turning it off?
pastebin it!

can someone help me get access to my vista shares, somehow all I get are read and delete permissions. :S
so what else permissions do you need on a share?
Modify of course
isn't the 'write' the same?
Yes I dont have write only read and delete
so this is on vista part, write click on share and add more permissions
I can create files, and delete them. But I cant write in the files. Don't think it's a vista problem, I have full permissions for my user on this share.
login screen wont start due to security policies. then it cant start /dev/wacom. says that last bit over and over

I'm issuing an official "never mind" for the GNOME Do problem as it seems to have been resolved by a quick tweak. But I have another question.. Is it possible to go through Synaptic and download, say, a .deb of a certain program and just save that instead of automatically installing it? I'd like to keep a small collection of installation files for programs I commonly use (Pidgin, Xchat, etc).
it's possible with apt, not sure about synaptic
im trying to copy a large file from my flash drive and paste onto my main drive , but the paste option is greyed out. why?. i dont understand why its greyed out. im new to ubuntu
you probably don' t have write permission to the folder
i see...
why does it say i have 9gb unused in gnome partition editor but azureus says the disk is full ?
it's the 10% reserved for root.
how do i turn that off
i'd rather run ubuntu on x86's but thats just my opinion. im pissed now that apple is using intel chips
you'd prefer amd? ;)
:)
Anyone know how to go from a standard install to a server install? Without the CD?
uninstasll everything thats not in the server isntall :P
Already tried that approach. Seems to have screwed up my wireless connection.
oh well.  why do you want a server install?.  use the computer as server?
I want more space on my computer; only have 2GB HD..  I tried the other apprach, removing packages. So far so good, except for my wireless connection..  Everyone keeps telling me to try a server install and then add the packages I need from there.
ok.  then do one.  or did you say something like, I dont have a cd drive
Yes, I don't have a CD drive. So I'm wondering how to run a server install.
then how did you get ubuntu in the first place?
Long story.
humm
Don't I just need to change the sources.list or something?
same reps.  keep removing packages until your done then try getting wireless up and running.  try to figure out which package you removed that screwed up wireless
When you uninstall packages, what are some good things to check after (to make sure everything is running okay). For example, apt-get -f install
whats the package for ati drivers?
fglrx
is that the exact name?
I think so. Search synaptic to be sure.
foolsrun, i cant.. i am using my intergrated video and xorg wont start.. so i need the exact name... i dont know how to apt-get search anything

I'm trying to build a boot floppy.img under feisty (not for feisty for my own i386 kernel for qemu), I've tried the i386 grub that comes with amd64 ubu but that complains about not being able to find a file when doing a device map. if I recompile a i386 version (and copy over the i386 stages from a precompiled tar) it seg faults and doesn't give me a core dump. I tried to compile it in i386 chroot and cross compilers for 4.1 and 4.2.2. Can anyone. help me?
i don't know much about cross compiling, but does it have to be a boot floppy? qemu can also read kernel and initrd directly from filesystem
it's not a linux kernel, it's my own
i see
and it's multiboot so it needs grub
Oh that's it, I'm so stupid.. The kernel is outdated... This one is a dualcore!
dual core should not matter, the default kernel is smp enabled
Good to know. I'm a big big green novice heh..  Mind you both my mouse and keyboard are ps2... Wont that prejudice the solution?

hello all. i have an ubuntu desktop (10.10) & a 10.10 server however, when i type sudo apt-get install <pkg_name> I get tab completion to assist me on the desktop edition. however, in the server edition the tab completion doesn't work at all.... is there something different that needs to be done on the server? (missing packages perhaps?)
do you have the bash-completion package installed ?
i can check - however, its a default installation so it hasn't changed much - doesn't it get installed by default?
not sure
the said package is installed

hi, the installer says there is no other OS installed. is it now likely that Grub will fail to include Windows? (of course I choose another than my windows partition)
its rather easy to add other OS"s to grub's menu.lst if it misses them..  seems odd that its not seeing tthe other os's
oh I have windows hibernated so acess to the drive might be bloccked. could that be the probem?.  partition, not drive.  but it doesnt see my old ubuntu either (wanted to erase that)
howdy
!!!
thanks for the help but unfortunately as predicted it made no difference with my sound issue.
- sorry I figured as much... P.s. did you do linux-686 or linux-image-686?
linux-image-686, why would it make a difference
- linux-686 may have some other dependencie - I'd put it in too (it's sort of a dummy package to make sure dependencie are filled).  - won't help with sound likely - just sayin'..
I will try anything..  do you know anything about sound issues?

trying to disable alt-tab showing windows from all workspaces. Have tried the obvious "bias windows from current workspace" option in Unity under CCSM. Does not seem to work, this is Ubuntu 13.04. Any suggestions?
personal suggestion: ditch unity, go get gnome.  or kde, whatever floats your boat
can I use that from Ubuntu 13.04. I would love to stick a dagger into Unity's head

energizer, So really do nothing and go to #archlinux and let them see the last image and know that you have a uefi set up and they can best help you install.. energizer, WE got you to the install stage, they will know whats up in your setup for success. ;)
at the moment i dont have a swap partition. should i make an arch partition and then a swap partition before going over there?
energizer, I wouldn't building partitions are part of the install in arch.
(but my ubuntu doesnt have access to a swap paritition. isnt that shitty?)
You only need one swap arch will build it.. energizer, Heh, and if you thought this was confusing a arch install will really be a challenge, it is a bit easier now, but it has its pitfalls.

Hi. is there any way to permit non root users to bind to ports < 1024 (without using sudo) ?
no, a root process is needed to open one of those ports, but you can hand it off to a non-privileged user. The technique, however is over my head
thanks. not the answer that I was hoping for. In my mind, there should be a way to configure linux to permit non root users to bind to lower ports.

How can i terminate the X server. I want to use "tty" to save more time when using battery.
you can modify grub to start in text mode and then start the windowmanager
How to do that?
Ask a question if anyone can help they will.
depending on your DE, go to settings -> power -> laptop close actions. worked for me under gnome shell, not sure what the exact path is for Unity
on power hibernate but it doesn't seem to do that.
I never hibernate under Ubuntu, try setting it to suspend. That's what I've always used
Suspend is to sleep?
Yup, suspend is sleep
So it should not get hot when in sleep right... I come back and my laptop is really hot..
Suspend is the equivalent of Sleep in Windows. So no, your laptop shouldn't be getting hot during suspend. AFAIK
I will try it.
how can i get gnome apps to open up the online help or "translate this app" in a new tab inside the same instance of opera browser? Because currently, a new instance of opera is opened.
I don't think you can ATPIT
what's atpit+. ?
what's the deffault url to get to my router settings in a browser?
open a terminal, type ifconfig, and look for where it says eth0 (only if you're using one NIC and not using a wireless card)
that advice is for what? port forwarding?
type that and give me the ip address
inet addr:192.168.2.3 Bcast:192.168.2.255 Mask:255.255.255.0.  i found my dell router's port forwarding settings page.
so you must type: 192.168.2.1 in your web browser to get to your router settings
Port Forwarding Settings page says that Port Forward is enabled for Transmission. Incoming port is "1~1". Destination IP address is 192.168.2.3..  yes, i'm on my router settings now.. how do i get an open port for transmission?
what port did you put for transmission to use?
you mean in Transmission's program settings or my router settings?
in the transmissions...
by the way,  according to http://www.portforward.com/help/portforwarding.htm, port forwarding is needed only if NAT is not working. Can we not get transmission to use nat, so that we can avoid port forwarding?
can anyone help me install wine?

Anybody know how to fix the problem with fglx not running properly on an IBM Thinkpad A31p (even though it worked fine with fedora core, and suse)
I have a T43p, and just avoid fglrx entirely. It's a buggy mess.
That's what I assumed =) Darn.  fedora core 6 came with 1 click setup of fglx and compiz =(
Interesting. Pretty sure I'd rather have the radeon driver though...
I'd just like the convenience of having my video card choice not be a big deal. =)
Okay, I copied it as .config to my /usr/src/linux-source-2.6xxx/ and I get the same error
time to read the Makefile and look for where it's looking for the kernel config

lucid lynx, fx 3.6 latest flash plugin from partner repository
fx 3.6 =firefox?.  i'm a lilttle confused as there appear ot be a couple adobe flash plugins..  i usually abbreviate it to ff for firefox, yea got 3.6.8 here also running lucid and running the non-free version of flash here too
fx is the abreviation acording to the wiki ;)
ok.  looking in synaptic I see two. I have installed flashplugin-installer and flashplugin-nonfree 10.1.53 but there is another one called adobe-flashplugin 10. What is the difference?
adobe-flashplugin is from partner repos i belive, flashplugin-nonfree is actualy empty (it can be removed with no priblems) and redirects to install flashplugin-installed
i'm confused. I should also ask whether your is a 32 or 64-bit system install. Maybe this makes adifference to flash working for paltalk express or not?
myne is 32bit. mine*
ok, same here, so, why not working here? mystery.  hardware?
are you sure you don't have another plugin for flash installed <unconvertable> like swfdec or gnash
positive...
no idea then
i'm not the only one. most peoples flash crashes when they try to run paltalk express. apparently its got issues running under linux.  i do have swfdec-gnome installed yes

which profile are you looking for?

yes.  looks like a bug
do you have the other plugins used by the mp3 gstreamer pipe installed?
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-media/+bug/124437
i believe there was a id3mux one or something
ah, i see
those plugins are contained within different packages...make sure you get the multiverse versions also to make sure you get the complete collection. it should work
yeah, thanks. installing gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse got it working. seems like a bug that the UI shows impossible things though

ppc64: what about fedora fc4 ?
have you used fc4 on a G5?
No, I have a Imac G3, and you ?
i was just wondering if it was truly 64-bit, or they labeled it so
To check, I suppose trying to make a fc4 ppc64 should fail on a 32 bits machine
we are both behind the times http://ftp.uni-augsburg.de/pub/tuxppc/test/
great
i'm readin up on fc4 and i see a lot of "you need to pursuade x.program to run on your G5". lot of "this 'should' work on your G5 now".  i'd stick with ubuntu
I will do that too. I am switching from yellowdog to ubuntu
that's good. ydl is good, but for the RPMs.. .... <gagh>
yum does its job Honestly, but the packages are old
Q: I have two HDs. One with Ubuntu & one with XP. How can I dual boot them?

I'm trying to get MythTV working on a new machine with 15.10. I typed "sudo status mythtvbackend" and I got this: "tatus: Unable to connect to Upstart: Failed to connect to socket /com/ubuntu/upstart: Connection refused" ... which seems ... bad.... and then I read online that ubuntu replaced upstart ... is that true? What am I supposed to use for services?
you may find this helpful: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemdForUpstartUsers. upstart was replaced with systemd, and that wiki gives a decent rundown
ok I'll check it out.. SystemD seems like a real winner with all these commands. So much simpler.. #newStuffIsNew but still #simpleCommandsAreBetter. ok so... if I want to diagnose "failed to load: no such file or directory" should I start at /etc/init/$job or is that just there to tease me, and the systemD files are somewhere else?
how can I check if a file is a regular file or marked as a conffile?
There's no metadata that says a file is a conffile or not
sure there is, that's how it checks for changes on upgrades
What's "it"?
dpkg, it says "conf file changed, install new/show diff/etc.". you know those prompts?

Question - can anybody tell me what the relevance is of pyNeighborhood with system-config-samba being functional? I noticed last night system-config-samba would not launch, a quick Google search revealed other users with a similar issue who reported installing pyNeighborhood solved their problem. I'm curious as to "why". What does pyNeighborhood do?
http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cts=1330971727991&ved=0CDcQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fpyneighborhood%2F&ei=SARVT_n5EKT50gH51MCwBQ&usg=AFQjCNF5hFJP5uauStLryBarMDECz_5Wug&sig2=9bJThJsmjL6L9_3Mzfj__w
it doesn't make sense as to why my laptop does not have pyneighborhood installed and system-config-samba works great, yet my htpc needed it installed to work.

yes, and then, once Windows is installed, boot to your Live disk again and follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows

Hey guyz I need an invite to join EFnet server..
not here you don't
how do you suppose where...I just need some assisstance..
1.) efnet server is not an invite server 2.) this channel supports ubuntu not "invites to different IRC networks"
I was just hoping someone is in here connected to the same server..
I'm connected to it, but I don't see how that changes anything based on the information I've just given you
so that one can be of assisstance...  : How bout you just give some appropriate suggestions about the same..
there is no ip in
Then I presume the interface you want to have that address is configured dynamically?
yes its given by dhcp. but its the wrong
hi can anyone help evertime i try and connect to my shared hdds over wifi i get a error saying message timeout by bus error mesage
-> can you post in pastebin that error? from which log file?
i cat it flashed up one the screen. its not a log file
i want them both to co-exist. :)
that's my hope. but i have a feeling that debian is losing market share. almost everyone i know who used debian has moved to ubuntu and ubuntu-server
they got their market - servers - right?. darn :/
heh.  i moved from debian to ubuntu-server
it worked better than debian? ;P
the defaut configuration options were far too sane and the packages far too up-to-date for me to NOT do that.  i'm running a prerelease of dapper on my ubuntu-server machine, and it's *great*. I've had zero problems with it once i got it installed
i'm running dapper as desktop OS right now, and i've had no probs
I had a problem with the installer when I tried to use XFS as the root filesystem. but apparently XFS and grub don't always get along, from what i've heard. I'm using a 3ware hardware RAID 1 card too. everything has worked very well. all problems i've had on that machine have been PEBKAC. heh
the only problem i got is apt-getting build-dep wine
i can not complain with a 68 second boot time (to the xserver). jonathaN: it rocks
yeah true
does anyone agree with me about my thing for the extra repO?
I'm having troubles getting a 32 bit version of ubuntu installed on a VirtualBox machine. I get the image loaded up and try to select any of the main options menu and it just freezes up. Any ideas on how to get this to work?

Any help to unlock keyboard? pleeese!

Hi Brian! I presed shift several times and my keyboard got locked. I want to unlockk it. Any idea?. Brian98: I can't use my keybord under Ubuntu, it's locked. No output!

Brian98 Yes. Brian98 It saved the setting I guess

Brian98 I could get terminal by using the mouse.
Hi there everyone, I've plugged in a stratitec all-in-one flash card reader, with one HDHC card, but it does not show up in KDE. Any help?
Tgp1994 have you formatted the FLASH card with Windows?
Actually, the first time I formatted it in the Wii :( So windows can't even recognize it.
Tgp1994 depending upon whether that flash card is legit or not, and when I say that is that I recieved a Kingston 64 gig flash and it was fake card. It works great but Windows was not able to format it. That was a problem, but I fixed it though.
If the Wii can format it though, shouldn't it be legit?
It depends.. Did you try to format the card in Linux?
And I mean with the homebrew file browser, I can browse it, but that's something else. I'm just concerned about linux recognizing it. ACTually, I wouldn't mind if I could just reset the FS..  Ya, I don't know how, I don't know the device ID.
why isn't passwordless ssh working for me?
probably because you're not doing it right
thanks 
so what method are you trying to use?
i've done it before but it's not working this time, ..  I have openssh-server installed... generated keys.

you know how compiz makes your workspaces into a cube? Is there any way to make each side of the cube a different desktop?
you mean a different desktop background?
like with differnt programs/folders
alkisg: I tried reinstalling the desktop, but couldn't due to dependency error. I lack the qtbase5-abi-5-5-1 which is supposed to be a part of libqt5core5a package which I already have. I don't know how is that possible.
pastebin the outputs
http://paste.ubuntu.com/25803343/
cat /etc/apt/sources.list is everything enabled?
The whole file seems blank.
really?.  pretty sure about that?
Both cat and less display a blank line.
ls -la /etc/apt/sources.list what's the file size
2
well, it seems you will have to recreate it then
Any suggestion where should I start?
just to double check, what is you are getting when you sudo apt-get update
I do get the sources, strangely.
what about apt-cache policy kubuntu-desktop
http://paste.ubuntu.com/25803460/
what is the name of the package you purged.  also apt-cache policy software-properties-kde
libqt5core5a. I did it due to the same dependency problems I'm having now. I panicked and interrupted it when I saw it was purging whole KDE along with it. I later performed an apt-get -f install. It is still there, though. KDE apps and GTK packages that remained are marked for autoremoval.

huh? less doesnt seem to have anything to do with mount?
less has much to do with how to read man pages
okay- so I think its unmount the windows drive- then mount \media\hda1 -ro ?
sounds about right. Also, change the "default" option by "noauto" in /etc/fstab
I see, thanks a lot

well I found something by that name so it probably is
any other options?
i've no experience with the program, don't have it installed.  error seems odd though
yea its in the program, but when I type any of the commands I get that same message

*checkbox
so yeah, I have rights on cdrom (I'm arjan)

what changed Iceman?
I guess the eth0 interface was unconfigured. so I just reinstalled the server. while connected to a network
ah, could've easily fixed if you'd been able to see text  :(
yeah, probably. I always get unusual situations, heh
:)
updating the system now /o/
depending on what you want to do with the server you'll probably end up doing very similar to the solution anyway to set a static IP 
I set up my router to give out the same IP. based on MAC
static DHCP leasing, ok
yup
that's one way >8)
I want to have an external point to tunnel from, mostly. and an irssi client thats always connected. oh.  maybe you know. I've installed the LAMP modules, whats a good way to monitor my system via the web ?

dkms .. that builds a driver, be patient
I doubt that. No gcc, cc, make or any of the normal build tools running anywhere
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DKMS. "The package compiles and installs into the kernel tree. "
does it setsid the build process and run them separately? because this is the process tree: https://bpaste.net/show/12e7471e4a2d
more subtile would be: unpacks and configures
hello. I tried a variety of ntp servers to update time but can't contact any of the servers. I'm on a university network which blocks traffic other than HTTP traffic. is that a possible reason?
correct. ntp is not http

This sucks i cant hook my computer wont pick up network printer???. i cant hook my computer wont pick up network printer???. i cant hook my computer wont pick up network printer???. i cant hook my computer wont pick up network printer???. but im able to ping
Is this a supported network printer?.  If so have you tried to setup the printer manually using cups config at http://127.0.0.1:631/ ?
see thats the problem its been working fine for past few months even after i reintsall but this time wont work
So an aready added printer stopped working?
i had to reinstall ubuntu yesterday.  i have this problem
SpiritsInside: Try rsh? (shell for ftp/scp users, blocks other commands)
last time i installed printer i had to use proprietary drivers with the sudo dpkg -i --architecture force command.  this is 64 bit
I don't know your printer model so my help is limite(and I'm short on time) but try to do it from CUPS web interface as stated earlier and give it the IP to the printer?
what is cups
Maybe you might need a multi-lib or chrooted version to use the driver which is probably 32bits?.  Cups = Printing backed for MOST linux systems, can be accessed from http://127.0.0.1:631
what is the sudo force command again??
sudo just runs a command as root.. (when placed in the first part of the command)
yeah i got 2 .deb files which are 32 bit.  but

you may still be able to run the command
I've been using aptitude and can identify teh missing packages, but get the 'temporarily unavailable' error. Yep I've tried that command - no joy

Hi, does anyone know a way to run an always-on VNC server that presents the GDM login screen? This used to be possible with xinetd but that no longer works.
try NXServer from NoMachine, way better than VNC
I use NX for outside my network, but inside my network I use Mac clients and want to make user of the built-in VNC "share screen" buttons in Finder.. Unsurprisingly "use NX" is the only response anyone ever seems to get to this question. It's not what I asked.

you know any window border theme, with left window text?
how is it aligned now?

Hi there, anyone have any ideas about what could be limiting the total number open sockets for a process? ulimit -n is set correctly

how to make a exe file ask for my permission??
please don't send PMs with your question
[thor] ok. [thor] can u tell me how to do that?
what does this mean: make: *** No targets. Stop.
just what it says. you'll need to specify a target, like "make clean" or "make all"
err the instruction says nothing about that so i am a little unsure what to do now, could you have a look at this please:.  http://bpmdj.yellowcouch.org/setup.html
have you run ./configure yet?
as i havent found a configure file nope?
you can try generating one with "autoreconf -i" in the top source directory. assuming that the thing has been written properly. the normal three-step is "./configure; make; make install". if that doesn't work, try contacting the authors, or other users if they have a forum of some sort.
ah there is one, sorry but all that does is give out the compile.txt in the same folder, that would be this one: http://www.nopaste.org/p/aemyLP7reb don't say much new there...
also, you'll need autoconf, automake, libtool, and the like installed
yepp i am aware of that and sometimes you can also make without a configure file.  umm i have build-essential installed
that's fine, iirc
have you seen my line about the configure file and with the link to the compile.txt? cos that one really isn't very substantial...:-/
actually, the compile.txt file has some useful information. have you made a link to one of the define files it mentions?
link? i tried to compile with -f definitions.debiabn, that wrong?.  defines file looks like this btw: http://www.nopaste.org/p/a11ouYj7gb
well, that's definitely not a makefile. not the greatest documentation here, i have to say.
definitely agree on that.  so what would you suggest?
give me a moment
yes of course, sorry

i have another partitioning question if someone would be so kind. when creating the /home partition is it a logical or a primary? i assume logical
up to you, makes no difference.  but due to the limitation to 4 primary-partitions, you should prefer using logical-drives for all

have u selected the beryl window manager or are you still using metacity?
how do I know that?
do you have the beryl icon in your tray? the gem thingy next to the clock?
no next to the clock I do have the volume and then internet and then normal software such gaim. How do I do that?
Go to System Tool in the menu and start the beryl-manager.
OK. It is the configurations... and now?
if you started the Beryl Manager there should be the try icon i was talking about.
nop...
If you do not have the beryl manager. do 'sudo apt-get install beryl-manager'
I have the beryl manager, I can see "Beryl Setting Manager" but I open it and I can change configs, but I do not see the difference and neither the icon
Setting Manager and Beryl Manager are two differnet things

I want to try this experimental multitouch driver: http://bitmath.org/code/multitouch/ I already compiled and installed it, but I can't make my system use it
I tried to install a program but its telling me i need GTK2+ runtimes but I install Gtk2 dev .. dont know what to do?
what are you trying to install

no. i can scan fine.. but wanted the GUI

no

But you understand there is no need for antivirus in Linux/ubuntu
I know ... but my main point is that I cant run the program?. because of GTK runtimes
It is best to stay in the official repos expecially if you are new to linux.  YOu are running into a dependency problem.. to fix it you must install the required pieces that will make your package work.
I tryed jack. I run the dev GTK installed the Lib -- but the only runtimes I can find is in win32

strange, my autocpmplete works too, but in /etc/bash.bashrc it's commented out. seems my ~/.bash_profile isn't read. is this normal for gnome?
you want ~/.bashrc. .bash_profile is only read for login shells
yes I know. Thats something of gnome then, not reading the profile
yeah, because you've already logged in, via gdm, so starting a terminal isn't a login, see?

I mean, I want to write a program to run on server that will wait for clients to connect and clients can login and perform operations on server(say writing data to a file). I have a lot of programming experience but I have never written programs to work over a network. Thank you
It's a Ubutu support channel, not a programming one.
I know, but I don't know where else to ask. People are experienced here, so i though somebody might know

hi all, could any one help me on how to port forward(80 & 22) to my IP, this is the UI of my GateWay's http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/GlobespanVirata/GS8100/BitTorrent.htm .. plz guide me how to port forward; in the dialog box{ Nat Rule Information } what should i add..
not a ubuntu question. offtopic
i would like to setup webserver on my ubuntu.. but i need portforwarding for that.. plz help

so where's the best place for the solution #ubuntu-offtopic ?

I would like to know where a specific android studio plugin I have downloaded lives on my ubuntu sytem. I type find / -name 'genymotion'. actually sudo find / -name 'genymotion'. and it just kind of hangs. whats the actual find commany?
you need to add asterisks before and after the name in ' in case it has extra characters before or after
d?
e.g. find / -name '*thingtosearch*'
hmm its still just kind of sitting. how long should it take to find a folder?

hello, can i use some instant messenger in order to communicate with other people in a LAN?
gaim
thanks, but the connection would be through the msn server or the LAN? Should i make another profile?
if i are in path /sdfd how do i look in the path before that one and build on that path?. root/current-path root/some/dir/i/try/point/to
../
../some/dir/i/try/point/to <- does that work?
".." means "parent directory"
to start look from root again i mean. i know it does, but does it work if you build on it. it did
use a variable set to the starting point. E.g. BASE="root"; ls "$ROOT/current-path $ROOT/some/dir/i/try/point/to"
hmm thats smart thanks

when I add a user and login I get No Directory, logging in with HOME=/ - how do I fix this?
you might need to specify a home directory for that user
when createing the user?
yes.  or with usermod or another account info modifier
so something like useradd user -d user
-d /home/user
what about -m?
that will make the home directory if ir doesn't exist already. *it
hmmm, type useradd user -d /home/user -p password. it creates the user but wont accept the password?. grrrr, I am still getting No Directory logging in with home

try typing pulseaudio ---start
doesnt seem to have an effect. there was no output from the command. so no error

Hello guys!. I am trying to log to a ssh service on a server as root and I've heard it is not possible.. Could someone point me a reason I could search for more information related please?
ssh url
what is that ?
Sorry, just: ssh [insert url without brackets]
I know that, but what do you mean ?
To log in, you would have to have those privileges on your account.
I know but I am unable to connect from outside my local network as root.
Did you try su or sudo?
as sudo ssh ?
Yes, or just plain sudo.
not haven't tried it. are you sure about that ?
No, but it doesn't hurt to try.
the point is it doesn't make sense what you are saying.
is it safe, to change hoary to breezy in /etc/apt/sources.list and do and update && dist-upgrade?
generally. but i would advice to remove openoffice first. it borked my upgrade. just install it again after your done. oh, and install ubuntu-desktop before you dist-upgrade. ubotu, tell  about breezyupgrade
i installed OO by myself, becaus the package in hoary was bad

windowmaker seems totally strange in 7.04: no key combinations work (e.g. no alt-tab). can somebody reproduce this?

how do i go back to original?
in WPrefs
how do i enable alt+tab? i didn't find an entry

what's gnustep?
i think it's select active window.  see www.gnustep.org.  is like mac os x cocoa API
no, it's not select active window.  am i supposed to use windowmaker with gnustep now?
no, you can use wmaker completely fine without gnustep

Hey guys, I'm having a problem- I tried to get my 3d acceleration working. and now Open Office won't start
toran: what did you try?
I installed xorg-driver-fglrx and updated my xorg.conf file. 3d acceleration isn't working (still) and oowriter won't start now

No. I try to start it and I see a whole lot of "API ERROR"s. "[fglrx] API ERROR: could not register entrypoint for GenerateMipmapEXT" <--I see a lot like this

netbet everytime I reboot my machine, a duplicate eth2 interface is detected and set-up with default options (DHCP). the REAL eth2 is set not to.
what is in /etc/network/interfaces ?
just the loopback. If I run an ifconfig I see all interfaces I should have (eth0, 1 and 2.
are you using network manager to manage your network interfaces? and what are your interfaces?
Apparently 8.10 doesn't like when you manually edit the network config. Found that out the hard way and started using the network manager GUI..  yes. Eth0, eth1 and eth2.
no, the network manager is just finiky, I usually uninstall it right off the bat :).  all three are ethernet connections?
But as I said... soon as I reboot, I get a second eth2 under the network manager..  Yes
does ifconfig show the extra eth2?
At the moment, no. Because I usually delete the second eth2 on start-up since I need eth0 as primary.

Hello, I submitted this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/993245 And I am wondering, what happens next? Am I free to reinstall my system and see if it persists? Would that be counterproductive to solving the bug?
you can probably adjust the harddisk sleep period to be longer than the average period between accesses if you worry about it..  see the hdparm package, and option called -S, configurable in /etc/hdparm.conf iirc
it's turned off. No sleep
really, you have disabled the standby timer? Perhaps the next thing to change is the power management, or maybe you want to extend your filesystem dirty flush period to, say, 5 minutes
It was disabled in power management. Let me check the hdparm thing.  My question was more directed to what was the next step in the bug report thing.
I'm pretty sure you'll find some hdparm -S250 like setting that will keep the drive running (if you are worried about the on-off thing, although these drives are ostensibly designed for this). alternatively you can try to arrange the filesystem flush period to be so long that the drives can spend significant periods asleep. I once had a linux box with very noisy ball-bearing harddrive set up in a way that often allowed HD to sleep for days (it was just a router).
-s: bad/missing powerup-in-standby value (0..1)
-S
-S: bad/missing standby-interval value (0..255)
yes. So you select a value that you think fits you.
What is the default?. or how can i check the default
*shrug* I don't know. if hdparm -S does not print the current value, maybe it's the sort of thing that can't be found out
ok I'll see if it does it again. monitoring now.  I set it do 255. does the same thing
okay. I guess the drive firmware just ignores the -S setting then.. you can try play with -B next, that's the advanced power management setting, 1 is most power-saving, and 255 should get rid of power-saving entirely. no idea what the values in between mean
but regarding the bug report, what will happen next?
hdparm manual page says that values between 128 to 254 does not prevent spin-down, so maybe -B128 for you?.  I don't know. I actually only just now read what has been written. I admit that desktop system complicates the matter, as there's probably some daemons that maybe use hdparm itself to manage these settings as you switch between the outlet power and not.. My experience with hdparm comes mostly from server-like use cases.
nono, I am doing this for the laptop. The desktop works fine..  the bug is only for the laptop
also what do i use to open a trouble ticket?
you can try this .. sudo modprobe -r psmouse ; sudo modprobe psmouse
its obviously not debbug :) the maintainer of ia32-libs apparently wants to know if ppl have to manually install extra ia32 libs to make a common app work.  thank you, ill try that next time

Hello. I have windows 7 installed and i've booted up from a usb drive ubuntu 14.04 to install side by side with windows 7 but when I go to make the partitions for ubuntu i dont see the windows 7 partitions just the entire harddrive
so win7 occupies your whole hard disk and you have no partitions? if so why are you surprised?
No it doesnt windows 7 only occupies 50% of the harddrive
well from what i recall there are some options on the install, something like use entire disk is one and custom partition is another, so i think there is an option before you get to that screen where you can choose to do it another way
ok ill have a look. there is an option for 'something else' which is what I am doing. then it brings up the list of hard drives and it just shows the entire hard drive and not the windows parititions
something else is the one but something is wrong there, whenever i have used it. it can see the partitions there and i can do stuff with them
hmm not sure what do to. to do*

how would i go about upgrading to that then?
you did the 32bit install right?

check out this thread. i guess you can in later versions as well ...  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1980509
no... The api changed. I used it on 12.04 also. but since I upgraded to 12.10 it stopped working
when you say you updated, did you run distro upgrade command or from scratch ?!
distro-upgrade. And also tried reinstalling that app. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/indicator-messages/+bug/1040259
i am wondering if the distro upgrade is what messed up the associated libraries . i am one of those guys who really does not like distro upgrades via command line ...  was there any error messages when you re-installed it in 12.10 ?
no error messages. gm-notify does not work because of the new api https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/indicator-messages/+bug/1040259.  Do you want to port gm-notify to the new api libmessaging-menu
does anyone know? the server requirement for nfs pxe diskless client server to support 100 users. what kind of ram/ cpu power is required? how low can i go?. 100 users browsing the web, watch video and software development, irc etc.
i would say 300 mhz per client, and 256 mb. + 300 mhz for server, and 512 mb.
that's very little right? why does 300mhz needed per client?. 300mhz * 100 = 30Ghz?! what kind of cpu is that?. does it really need so much power?
seems little, but enough for pxe..  100 pxe clients on one server, have you ever seen that?
not 30Ghz right? cpu poewr.  cybercafe?.  student campus computers?

lol, updating the font cache the fc-cache scans all the home folder and install 1000 fonts. haow can I solve the problem?
you want to remove fonts or control them ...yes?
I want that fc-cache scans only the folder .fonts in my home, not all the home folder.  obviously I have other fonts in the home folder, but I don't want to install them
mm I have not had this issue with regenerating font cache
It's the first time for me also
are you doing suod fc-cache -fv.  you could try sudo fc-cache (nameof directory)
I did sudo fc-cache -fv and had the problem, than sudo fc-cache -r (rescan)
try nameing the directory only with that...also there is a perfect application named font-manager,, that deals with fonts nicely makeing it possible to disable fonts on the fly.  man fc-cache doesn't have a whole lot of info associated with this however
it's very stange anyway.  I've installed font so many times and never had similar issues
yes it sounds so... as I said ,, I have not had this issue ,, ,I deal with fonts all the time,,.  it is odd.  unless the fc-cache "name of directory" command would be helpful
I used the command and it effectively loaded only that folder.  but I cannot manage to reset my actual cache
well that's a start :).  mmm
I'll try the ultimate resource... rebooting.  it works more than expected

: nmap'ing my default ip_addr-router gives me some opens ports such as 80 , 21 and others. Now, nmap'ing my ip_addr-Internet providing service gives me same open ports as 192.168.1.1. No difference in my machine
its probably a coincidence that the same ports are open
do you want me to screenshot that for you?
of what. i can sense you're getting annoyed lol.  if you open up routers port 80 to the world, port 80 would show up on an internet scan, if you only open it to lan, it wont.  if you scan from a lan address itll show up
no not at all, I am not annoyed, I was trying to understand you
but what im saying is, if you have a pc with lan address 192.168.1.123 and router has port, say 8118 forwarded to it, port 8118 wont show up if you scan 192.168.1.1 from 192.168.1.123.  as the router isnt the one listening on that address. *poty. port*. lol
Now I get it. You were talking about local machine ports Versus ISP ip address ports. Then of course you won't get same ports I know that. I thought some else
basically if youre doing port scan on your router (looking for open ports) its not gona show ports being forwarded. as you are looking "up" to a single device rather then "down" from the internet at several devices
all marked as unknown
then things did gowell :)

what is the regex for lines that do not contain the 'locale' word?
for what program?
any... I just needed the RE
well, if you're using, say, grep, you just match on locale and throw the -v flag
like grep -v .*locale.* ?
just grep -v locale
what would I do if I wanted the line to be exacly locale, then?
Have anyone faced the strange issue with language switching: sometimes when you begin to type it automatically starts to change language after every typed symbol?
sure..  hit ctrl space to disable ibus input
oh, thank you. I hope it helps
how many languages you have in ibus-setup
I suppose two. Russian and English
the top one creates issues, ie won't launch?
no, it's just when I type something it changes language every next letter and it goes something like that "smtig lk ht"
my ibus is acting very strangely as well, identical setup. I'll check launchpad for bugs
maybe you know if it's possible to use xorg.conf for configuring layouts in maverick.  I was unable to type when I tried to add keyboard stuff into there
does ibus-setup let you change
it told me that ibus is turned off.  is that because I pressed ctrl+space.  anyway, it works after pressing ctrl+space just fine
what about alt f2 ibus-setup , should launch a configuration wizard
thank you very much
hi, i'm currently trying to upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04 but i'm getting a error (http://pastebin.com/GJaT7KCN). is this a bug in the upgrade tool?
Switch the software sources to all releases, turn off 3rd party repos and run a update and the update manager will work..  Make sure you are updated with no errors.
i did all of it...
file type is vfat
Is there an entry in fstab for it or have you mounted it manually?
mount command
is there a way to remove a specific package without removing dependencies, like a force command
without removing dependencies? or without removing packages that depend on it?
without removing packages that depend on it
that would break package management (bad), so no. Only way you can do it is create a dummy package
ugg, my lirc didnt get setup right cause i didnt it through chroot on my appleTV, and i dont want to uninstall all this other crap lol
anyone have an idea why my system is hibernating when it should be suspending?

hi all, i am unable to boot to windows normally and have to use recovery mode. when i do that I get "failed to initialize hal", any ideas?
You're looking for ##windows. This is #ubuntu.
whoops, i don't know why the hell i typed that, i meant to say ubuntu. windows boots fine
allright, i give up i tried everything! where the hell are the 516 mbs that i downloaded?! and y did nothin happen after apt-get upgrade?!?. any ideas?!
?.  you mean you downloaded pacakges from the net?. what does 'at-get upgrade' say? when you run it from the console
no, i want to upgrade uo hoary
it's called 'dist-upgrade'
i changed the srouces.list ran, apt-get update.  yes yes, that;s the one,.  i went away for a way came back, all i got was that i downloaded 516 mbs, 6 packages failes, and that is it!
someone told me upgrade to hoary is like 'cat /etc/apt/sources.list |sed s/'warty'/'hoary'/g > /etc/apt/sources.list' && apt-get dist-upgrade
what should i do now?! i restarted, nothin happened,.  well, yeah, i did that!
hmmm so if you rerun apt-get dist-upgrade nothing happens?
after dist-upgrade nothin happened!. well, i don't want to do that, coz then it'll start downloading again!
you should not. once you downloaded the packages they should reside in the apt-cache folder. unless you run apt-get clean
i donno what to do now, if they are in apt-cache folder, how do i install them,. dpkg -install -r <dir>. ??
simply run apt-get dist-upgrade. it should instead of redownloading them, simply use those in cahce
again?! is there away to stop it if it stands downloading?!
no. well <crtl>-<c>. but that's not what you want.. if it downloads packages, it only downloades packaes you have not yet got.
hehehe! that was easy! wish u were here like an hour ago! i asked the fricking question 100 times with no answer!!
to see if your packages are there take a look into /var/cache/apt/archives
it is downloading 167kbs from 516 mbs! :)
well. Gotta go... You sould probably consider, when upgrading gnome, to delete all your .gnome{2,}{_private,} folders
unpacking packages now!! yippi yey! thanks !
and kill gnome-panel. And restart gdm
i'll restart x and that would do it right?
can someone give me a quick run down on ssh. how to use it

Hello Guys.. Where does cheese save the vidoes / photos? I mean, in which path?
~/.gnome2/cheese somewhere in there?
it's not there..
IS there not a folder in there for "media"?
I found it.. ~/Videos... hauahuaha
I am starting to get really pissed off. Last night at 10:30pm ubuntu restarted itself without warning, and it just did it again not more than 5 minutes ago.. Where do I even start diagnosing that issue?
Probably a hardware issue..  Could be that your processor is overheating.
what is "hpet increasing min_delta_ns to 22500 nsec" ?
Is it a desktop PC?
Laptop PC
What model?
Dell Inspiron 640m
Could be an issue with acpi

My video display is messed up. i have boxes replacing characters. How can I reset the video system without rebooting?
if you mean and keep programs running, i don't think that's going to happen
yes I mean't keep programs running, however now it went back to normal. Quite odd
must be an open driver / slightly wonky system. you can try toggling between TTY1 and back again sometimes
I think I do have a driver issue. Laptop is a Lenovo ideapad Z560 Vmware player says I have no 3d support
well vmware player has nothing to do with the host OS operating
no Vmplayer was saing my host has no 3d support
right but that doesn't have any relevance to the host graphics going odd. or are you saying it was a guest.... Descriptioned: IRC as root? :)
No it was graphics on my laptop but when I launch a guest OS of windows 10 vmware says hardware acceleration is not available because of my linux driver.
and which driver are you using?. assuming you're after help with that and not just tangenting :). yeah oops alright :)
Whatever driver Ubuntu 14.04 installed when I installed it. The Vmware is just a tangent
oh ok so you're not asking for help on it? nevermind then
No I'm not asking for help on the Vmware issue. I am asking for help on the Ubuntu hoist os issue. I think the graphics problem are related to the driver on the host os
alright so identify what graphics hardware you have first, by pastebin'ing "lspci" .. you can't say you think that when i already said i think that :P

was there a kernel update yesterday for 16.04?
no
was there any in these past few days? because a dkms module randomly broke and won't compile anymore and thats the only reason i can think of
I have a question: What are the advantages/disadvantages of using 64-bit Ubuntu instead of 32-bit Ubuntu?
64-bit will recognize a larger amount of RAM, is more efficient for some types of calculations, and usually would be combined with multiple cores and be better for multi-threaded applications.
So... if I just have a pentium-dual core and just use it for regular use, no need...?
nn all
k
thanks for your help anyway
anyone elses /boot drive get full of old kernels?
"sudo apt-get autoremove"
yes i know to do that, just, it fails cause /boot is 100%. so i have to manually remove stuff, then do cleanup
I'd suggest your problem is one of the commonest mentioned on this channel
just didn't know if there is something that should be happening automatically to automatically discard the old kernels. perhaps there should be a package made that runs and keeps it clean, idunno. :). i got it sorted out, just didn't know if it was supposed to do that, sounds like it is whate everyone else experiences too
no. Ubuntu doesn't create a separate /boot by default. If you go against the defaults, it should be your responsibility
hmm, these are default installs. server installs. didn't create separate things at all
really???
just followed the wizard. really.. pop in the cd, follow the wizard, end up with a server with /boot
Sound problem fix: Set to analog and digital output. It works for docking stations as well.
I can only see the analog devices there is no digital output
Check System->Pref->Sound->Hardware and change profile.. Should be Digital Stereo and Analog Stereo
well, How can then associate the nautilus to the folder at the gnome-panel
right click a folder and put a check mark in "open folder"

does the hostname dev.shutaf.im respond if you query it from the apache server in question
i get the page cannot be displayed
that's not what I asked.  from the apache server, can you resolve the full DNS name in question
how i do that?
have you ever hosted a website before ?
yeah. i ask with what tool i use

wow, virtual box is easy to use
yeah pretty much.  ive heard vmware its smoother than virtual box if installed on dualcore
ahh, just hit a problem, my vista disk is 64bit. it failed to load 64bit system :(.  yeh, this is a dual core.
is your system 32bit?
no, it's core2 duo, 64bit. nope,, def 64bit -4 2.6.27-7-generic #1 SMP Tue Nov 4 19:33:06 UTC 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux
hmm, sec
cool, thanks for this help :)
what version of virtualbox do you have (dpkg -l | grep virtualbox)
2.0.4
hmm apparently it does 64bit guests

In "System --> Preferences --> Session", how do you set a program to start minimized?
Use the program devilspie.
Why do I need a program to do that? Can't I do it from Sessions?
Your window manager Metacity is only a minimalistic program. It has not enough functionality.
I looked at devilspie, looks to complicated for me.
I hope that you have the opportunity to visit a local computer club and get help there.

maybe try asking your question in a way that I can actually understand it, by not referring to a web page that requires javascript just to render the DOM
i am trying to print in colors using linux on my toshiba printer
have you installed CUPS?.  install CUPS, then install a driver for your printer (you will need to search for your printer model, most probably), then try to print in color
yea i have cups installed, the printer works fine in black n white. in color tab i see no profile found

hey guys, i have a server that runs a software raid via mdadm, one of my drives died, does it matter if they are exactly the same or just have to make sure it's the same amount of space? it's a raid-1 setup. i wanna get a SATA drive this time instead of a IDE drive
you don't need drives the same .. in fact its often best if theyre not
sounds good to me, thx
well im off. i got it to work. americas army time!!
in linux ?
(800fps glxgears yay). yes. in linux
i've gotta get that setup... i got ut2004 and doom3 running
what vidcard?. i got geforce 2 go
nothing. type CTRL + ] to disconnect
seems to connect - if i type anything - it just says Connection closed by foreign host.
do you see: Connected to 8.8.8.8.. after you telnet?
yeah. it says connected
ok, so TCP works
guys, no help with installing the latest nvidia drivers?
which release/
10.04, is there a ppa with the latest nvidia driver? version 260 according to the nvidia website
has ANYONE used a wpc11v3 with ubuntu?. i think i'm the only one who has noticed that it stops working after a couple reboots.
I've been using one for several weeks now, actually.
what driver are you using?
I'm actually not even sure, it just worked. I'll check - just a sec.
ahh, so you haven't attempted to use kismet or anything like that?
No, I've just used network-admin and netapplet.
ok, i guess it doesn't really apply to me then. but you haven't noticed that after a few reboots you need to reinstall ubuntu to get the card to recognize again?
Shorewall any good?
no personal experience, but i know some admins that swear by it, and i generally respect them
ty . you have any personal favs ?
anyone know about multiple screens config for a laptop?

steals*.  you know what I mean ?
i agree with you, but whati mean is no reason for a portable + truecrypt... because it is not going to work with ease... anyway, my solution to that was to carry two USB sticks, one with some programs and the encrypted one, so i plugged both in the computer i use and use one to decrypt the other. but, if you don't have admin rights it is useless because you cannot *mount* things. so, i used to carry the installer yoo and install it on other computers i used to have access to. pruebaefectos: algunos hablamos espanol, yes some of us speak in spanish, pero si necesitas nuesra ayuda la puedes tener en ubuntu-es, but if youneed our help in spanish go to ubuntu-es.  but the best solution was to getmy own netbook and use it wherever i go and keeping the USB and the netbook both encrypted
ok so encrypting a usb stick isnt an ideal solution.. but its something I want to do
no, no, i mean it is the solution.  but you are not going to be able to plug it everywhere, because th problem is with the portable program
how do the commericial solutions do it?. companies like iron key etc
same problem, you need admin rights to open them
I still don't see why thats a problem
but it is more like plugging an ipone or other usb device with some intelligence inside
and what is the problem with that?
with no admin right no mounting.  wait... afaik, truecrypt installs on /opt... so maybe by copy/paste iles on a folder on your usb stick will do the trick. *files
naa my opt folder is empty.. but tbh I don't mind about needing admin rights to mount.. that really isnt my concern. so if you can get it working with linux / windows but it needs admin rights then thats a solution...  but I am still unsure as to how it works? I don't see an option for portable mode in truecrypt I am assuming by that you have to do it manually?
lol, what i mean is if you have a local truecryypt installed, then you have that files there.  yep, i think you have to do it manually
you aware of any tutorials? I don't really know how
not for linux, i used truecryp for a long time but mostly in Windows, in linux i installed it to access my windows partitions and so on. and my portable USB stick
ah np
my ideal solution is, encrypt it with truecrypt, the whole device, use another usb stick to hold truecrypt for windows and for linux and the installers, try to install them on computers you frequently use on other places, like work or office or a customer client that trust you, and it is going to work nicelly, as an extra you can installit on your netbook o laptop and you are able to open that USB even in the worst scenario
it would be nice to have truecrypt on the same drive as the encrypted files. I don't want to have to install it every computer I run the stick on. well I cant find any information about doing this on linux and its not obvious so I guess I need to get some advice from soneone that has done it before
ok, then put it there, i used two usbs just because i prefer to encrypt the whole device, but it is up to you.  and using truecrypt for windows in portable mode in one of them, never used the linux one
so I assume you would need two copies of truecrypt on the drive? one windows and one linux ?
yep.  the Windows version does have the portable mode, you it installs it for you in any folder you tell it to
are we literally just talking about copying /usr/bin/truecrypt onto the usb stick and thats it?
sigh it is on /usr/bin/truecrypt? you are going to need more files. give me a sec
sorry I don't know the exact path, I was just simply saying do you only need the binary
let me give it a look
cool beans
yep it seems it is installed on the system, in ubuntu it'll be a pain to getthe files
well I can get them from the tarball. ah naa you cant. there is just a setupfile in there.  well thanks for the food for thought, I will have a think about what I am going to do about this.. I need to get it encrypted somehow.. but IJ like the idea of it being portable.. nevermind
i have that old issue of mice pointer not wanting to be scaled, which is i think compiz related, what was/is the solution nowadays? (i did fix that in 10.10 somehow...). running 11.04 classic
If you're running try turning compiz off, scaling the mouse, and turning compiz back on. This is the most annoying thing ever IMHO
let me try...
I'm not sure it is the solution. Just an idea.
rings a bell a bit...
Jesus, how do I get gnome to leave my network connection alone or shut up about it? It makes my computer become unresponsive for a second every 3 seconds. I'm just doing connection sharing...
just go into it and pic the auto profile and set it to exactly what you want so it won't try to find and connect some other way.
thats what caused this scenario. If I unplug it, it calms down but then I can't configure it.
Hi everyone , how do I access file in a guest session from another user account?
: go to a little gear shaped button in the right top corner and click switch user
but I want to access it from another account.
: you mean as in remote or from the same computer?
same.  without swtiching user
ehmm. hi every1. sorry to intterupt ppl here. can some1 tell me which value to switch to text mode in inittab??. is it 3?
1
thx
that's single user mode....  if you want to just not start GDM turn off the script
text mode rite?.  eh? they change the way!!.  can u tell me which startup config file so I can turn off GDM?
go to TTY([CTRL] +[ALT] +[F1] ) and type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop.  this will end your X session and just give you a command prompt
okay. thx. thx. ur legend\
Running Ubuntu 10.10 whenever my computer becomes idle it becomes unresponsive. I'll wiggle the mouse as if to bring it back, but nothing works, so I have to restart X (CTRL+ALT+Backspace) to get it to work again. Ideas?

how would i overclock my processor with this set of hardware http://pastebin.ca/995645 ?
have you tried looking in your bios for overclocking options and stuff? I believe it's not specific to ubuntu, rather to your bios/motherboard
bios as in at the boot screen you press F12 or something like that?
hi, how can I run a script after wlan0 interface get an IP address automatically at boot? I tried to put the script in /etc/network/if-up.d/, but it doesn't work. it runs multiple times with each interface up, but run before dhcpd.
Are you using /etc/network/interfaces? If so, look at post-up in the man page.
thanks a lot. I found how to use post-up in google. but which man page do you refer to? I tried "man ifup" and "man /etc/network/interfaces". both does not have post-up description.
"man interfaces"
got it. thanks. one more question, should I create a script by root user or normal user? which user will execute that command? I guess it's root, right?
How do I turn off transparency in the terminal. I have a back ground image set but when I use the slider to 100% the background color covers the image, and the image remains transparent at any other value.
Did you try Edit | Profile Preferences | Background (tab)
I did. When I installed my drivers after a fresh install of 10.10 my term began to be transparent. I went to Edit->Profile Preferences->Background to set my image. When I do that, the term stays transparent and I see through the image. If I turn up the transparency to 100%, the background color from Colors tab, will cover the background image
I wonder if you have compiz or visual effects that are causing the transparency. Are your other windows transparent?
i have compiz but this issue started before I installed that. I installed compiz to try and turn it off.  I was looking in there for a way to add an exception to transparency
hello, i want automatic login and startx, how can i do this? i want to run openbox without an login manager
you don't have to run startx in a default ubuntu install and it's trivial to set it up with an automatic login.
its not an default installation.  in an default ubuntu installation i have an gdm as login manager and i will do it without an login manager
all you have to do in a default install is to go into system menu / administration / security tab and check the box for automatic login and select a user there.
but that uses the gdm.  and it starts the gdm, but gdm need to much RAM
yes, but the user won't see it, it will go straight in and log the user in.
its not about what the user will see ;). its about my memory
i changed the rsa host key on ubuntu-server, so what do i do on the other computers?. who want to connect to ubuntu server
over ssh?.  modify ~/.ssh/known_hosts
what do you mean  ?
You didn't say what protocol you're talking about. I assume it's ssh?
yes ssh. i did changed the .ssh/known_hosts (i delted it, and it asked me to add the new one, i said yes), but now it says permission denied (publickey). what am i doing wrong
you changed something with the public key files on either the client or the ~/ of the user you're sshing to.
ok how do i fix it now
depends, what did you change?
i made a new ec2 instance of ubuntu server... i think it made a new rsa host key. nothing is changed on the computer who wants to connect to ec2
allow password-based connections, then ssh-copy-id user@hostname on the client.
i am not sure, really.  oh yes.. i have pssword login disabled on sshd
although I don't do EC2, so that may or may not work for you.
when you say do ssh-copy-id user@host on the client, which pc do i run that from? ec2 or the comptuer who wants to connect to ec2
what's the difference between adm group and admin group anyway?
still a nogo on the sudoers stuff but sudo is working again
did ya add yourself to sudo group again?
yup.  its still asking for a password though... proper sudoers is 'user ALL=NOPASSWD:/cmd' no?
silly question, but what's the last line of sudoers.  if it's (ALL) ALL, that overrides everything set in the file.  yeah, that's the right syntax
I have been gone quite a while too, what the hell happened to this place?
not enough admins here aparently. !admin
yeah, so I've noticed... we really could use one..
hi all, whats this problem : number=$[ $RANDOM % 31 ] && sudo update-alternatives --set default.plymouth /lib/plymouth/themes/$number/$number.plymouth

of course the chance that the path doesn't exist if you use a randon number is big
$random is between 1-31..  and i create all of theme.  i want to use random plymouth
apparently there is a path configured for it that doesn't exist, so what about to drop that before?
rename all directory to numberic names

hi, what can i do if SIGTERM does not kill my processes?
try kill -9 or kill -15 <pid>
thank you for your answer. will those commands free the memory taken by the processes?
assuming the process ended, you should reclaim mem
I used sigkill and it seems that the memory is not as free as it should be. how can i reset it? will a reboot work?
how can my desktop be viewed remotely via the remote app (vnc)?
If you have enabled the built-in vnc (vino iirc), then go to another computer, install a vnc client (tightvncviewer, xvncviewer, realvncviewer, etc) tell it to connect to your ip and it should either connect or prompt for a password if you set it up.
i tried it but it doesnt work
Also, VNC isn't very secure on it's own, I recommend tunneling it over an ssh session(and recommend pubkey authentication for ssh).  Does it give you any error messages?
even ssh doesnt work. connection timed out
Are you connecting across a lan or over the internet?
over the internet
Did you forward the ports in the router?
i use a 3g modem

what's a good IM client besides gaim?
kopete is ugly if you're using gnome..  gaim is the best app for gnome.
I can't get to make gaim log yyyy-mm-dd it only gives the time
its logged into folders with dates, the file itself uses time. beagle can tell the difference
what's beagle?
i have a weird problem - when i try to do:. x=`ps -x`. or. ps -x | grep "blah". it says Warning: bad ps syntax, perhaps a bogus '-'? See http://procps.sf.net/faq.html
there are different versions of ps, -x isn't vaild on all versions, man ps to see ifyour version supports
ps -x works fien on its own. hm, doing just "ps x | blah" works fine
alias x='ps -x'.  copy and paste that
i guess it just doesnt like the -, as Pumpkin- said.  ah that works fine now. why does ps not use - for its arguments
it does.  hence why you can do ps -x
but why did x=`ps -x` not work
because you are using back ticks
but x=`ls -l` works
it's to do with how it executes it, I've seen this before with another command an alias
will that alias command now last forever/. ?
no, if you exit the shell it will go
is there a permanent solution?
but it in your bashrc
ah ok, just exactly the same as how you posted it?
yup
ok thanks.  is there a way to add that rule for all arguments?
that rule for all arguments ?. what do you mean ?
i want to also be able to do x=`ps -eax`. or x=`ps -aux`. or whatever
stop using back ticks.  if you type "alias" you'll see all the aliases use ' not `
' is a quotation mark
no, it's a single quote
if i do x='ps -eax' it will just echo the text 'ps -eax'
no it won't.  as you've just seen
i just did x='ps -eax' then echo $x and i get ps -eax as the echoed response. as in those letters. backticks have always been the way i assign commands to variables
you don't echo a command.  that is setting a variable, not a alias.  you said you wanted to do an alias. alias x='ps -ef' is an alias x='ps -ef' is a variable
oh. so is there a way to do alias x='ps -allArgs'. or something similar
what you are saying makes no sense.  you can alias what ever you want
but i dont want to have to alias every single argument of ps
is there a way to configure /etc/X11/xorg.conf to auto select what Video card is plugged-in or detected by system?
there is a line that you use to specify the PCI bus position of a card, yes.  called BusID

effectively, yes. use lspci to find out the bus ID for each device
btw, how do determine BusID from lspci or dmesg?

Hi everyone. I was wondering how I can use an ubuntu OS to be on all the time and act as a server for my radio station's audio. I want to log all input audio from an analogue source and serve it to the internet as a digital stream. I also want to take that audio and divide it into 30 minute or 1 hour discrete mp3 files, and then I want to serve up the last 3 to 6 months of those mp3 files to.... ...an online directory. Does anyone have any suggestions about what Ubuntu software to use for this?
you could use it as a fileserver if thats what you mean....or do you want to run the radio station off it toon
Yes, a fileserver would be fine. But It should also run the software that creates the audio files. It should also process the analog stream of audio into a digital file like .m3u and serve it to the internet. Do you have any recommendations of what software to use?
ChrosHonson>possible. What program is there to listen to radio with?
I use streamtuner and amarok a lot, vlc if url is known
know one that plays FM channels? or do those also?
many radiostations provide stream, or do you speak of a receicer-card
no reciever card. DaSEi: receicer*
receiver, y, many s stations stream via urls
I like foxytunes stations but it's a plugin for browser.. Ya I want a seperate program.
as said, streamtuner, amarok, audacious, many players can read stream.  or even winamp , if you're after the urls just
ya i was hoping i'd find a certain HD2 radio station that's on Foxytunes(Yahoo messenger plugin). No luck.
hey folks, i need to use a virtualmachine to run netflix streams, can anyone recommend one where i may get the best performance for this?
Try VirtualBox first. VMware is also good for this task.
which do you think i should try first?
If im collaberating with java with another person to develop, can we use openjdk and the normal java(i beleive the other person is using windows)
sure, the jdk used is interchangeable unless you're dealing with jvm specific runtime options (the -X namespace).  and even then at least openjdk and the oracle jvm (which I assume you mean with 'normal') are very similar there too
so its possible to develop a game using both openjdk and oricals java for windows using jmonkey3?. Thats one less heartattack i need :D
the code you write has nothing to do with the jvm it runs on.  if it does, that's a bug in one of the jvms by definition. erm,  ^
ok, thanks I assume its just the compiling phazes would be the difference lol

does anyone else experience problems with thunderbird and enigmail?. Enigmail initialization failed.. You are using GnuPG version 1.4.16, which is not supported anymore. Enigmail requires GnuPG version 2.0.7 or newer. Please upgrade your GnuPG installation, or Enigmail will not work.. this happens to me since yesterday
just update?
you mean like apt-get update?
2.0.29 is the stable version suggested for most users,
well there is no newer version of gpg offered
https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html
Ok I see. But my collegue has the exact same ubuntu/thunderbird/enigmail installation you know, and he has no issues with that
from the other side you can always downgrade ur enigmail, i suppose it was updated thats why it doesnt work with ur old Enigmail
ok so maybe enigmail was updated. I have to check that
are you 100% sure that ur collegue has exactly same versions?
bot about enigmail, I'm curerntly checking that. I was to fast with stating that, sorry
im not using GnuPG but i think its better to use more currenty recommended version than old one
I guess that this makes definitely sense. I mean it is a huge version jump
well im not sure of that.  check last post here.  https://www.reddit.com/r/GnuPG/comments/2qxw18/ubuntu_how_do_i_upgrade_gpg_keys_to_modern/
hehe ok

thanks for the hcl. The thing with first finding a printer and then checking compatibility is that it takes so much time.

hi, since my upgrade to feisty I get weird Input/Ouput Errors... I work in my shell, convert a qemu image and bam, /usr/bin/command-not-found: Input/Output Error.. the disk should be working, I tested with SMART and badblocks and no errors. ideas anyone?. and I'm quite sure its since feisty
what is the command you issue to convert? command-not-found is the tool used to tell you to install a program if it is not found/installed yet but you call it. It is called by bash, no idea what the input/output error is though, could not find info.
its not about converting but its about the input/output error =)
for bash to call command-not-found you must be calling a program that is not installed
it can't access the whole disk, as its giving me this message for EVERY command. like ls. df
so why didn't you state that earlier instead of confusing us with " I work in my shell, convert a qemu image and bam, /usr/bin/command-not-found: Input/Output Error". :-D.  did you try checking the file system?
is there a way to check my xfs root filesystem or will I need an external system?
not sure, but I think you can just run fsck on it without unmounting it (fsck needs the filesystem mounted anyway)
I will check that. thanks for helping anyway.

You might have to watch logs for any errors that fly by. maybe 'tail -f' a couple log files in other terminals..  What version since there are different instructions for Lucid 64-bit out there too
I tried this file but it has broken dependencies..  it's Raring 64-bit. I'll run it again and tell you just what I get.
This page talks about dependency issues (but it's Lucid, not Raring): http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1518425&page=5

Hi, "apt install sam2p" do not work whereas I see it here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sam2p/0.49.2-3 What should I do to have it installed?. I use Ubuntu 16.10
it's not in the 16.10 repos, looks like xenial was the last release it was packaged for.
So if I have luck I may install it by looking for the source?
there might be dependency problems that prevented it from being included, for example
Mh, seems this thing is quite old: "Parts of page may be obsolete. See sam2p on Google Code instead. " and 404 on Google code ...
so probably not included because it is deprecated/unmaintained. you'd better look for a replacement.
this was a dependency for an other software. So I will tell them they should switch to something else, or pack it inside.
sounds like the best option.
Thanks for the help ;)

why do you call it FUD....these are simple facts and we should be allowed to compare things with ubuntu in a ubuntu channel.
8 months?. this is not a fact, that is crap
yes  i have been installing gentoo for 8 months and it still is not finished.

does HTTPS use a different key for each request or does the browser generate one once and uses it throughout all of its requests on HTTPS ?
i doubt it generates a new key for each request
so would the public key of the browser be a good fingerprint for a machine ?

so then it can be used as a finerprint

sure, there should be both, using a mirror close to your location, like your ISP. minimal.iso and netinstall are both fine
should i used 32 bits or amd 64 to install it in vmware that runs on ms windows 7?
and fdisk says 'Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel'. can i totally erase the drive and do a new partition to it?
Hm you are not able to create a partition on it using fdisk or your favourite tool?
no, i can't. it seems like it does it, but when i reboot it doesn't has any partition
Hey all.. I am still having trouble booting... grub still does not show up after following a couple of tutorials. :-/.  No dice.
got an error message or something?
Nope, it just boots to a blinking underscore symbol. :-/
are you sure the problem is grub?
I am not SURE it is with grub.. but it only happened after I expanded my main parition after deleting an old one.. so I assume it has something to do with the bootloader..
also, tried deactivating the floppy drive and unplugging USB devices?.  but can you see the grub menu?
nope
can you paste files to pastebin?
Sure.....  What do you want?.  Actually, there does happen to be an error when I go to update grub.. let me try to replicate it quick.
I need the output from the 'lsblk' or 'fdisk -l' commands, and I need the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file
Okay.. here's where I get the error: http://www.pasteall.org/35244
I screwed up my video, im in low mode how do I fix it?. low graphics mode*
what did you do?.  leading up to the error
install a bad driver. I fixed it though. I uninstalled it completely now what?
can you install the correct driver? ;)
I still have the problem. kareese, I don't see it in hardware drivers and considering I screwed up last time I dont think its a good idea I try again.....
PIA? they do that for me, too.
i found an easy way to clean up the list of servers. brb
I've already done mine.
configure: error: *** GLIB >= 1.2.2 not installed - please install first ***. <-how do i install it?
sudo apt-get install glib?
vulkan it doesent work
how do i configure a network interface to receive a ip via dhcp?
networkmanager should do that automatically...

oh, sorry :)
not your fault, i didn't specify
give me a sec, my network conf does not use nw...
ok
Can someone help me to open Teamviewer on Ubuntu 12 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5845291. Thank you.
12 what?
<unconvertable> explain my problem on the link.
you propably is not in the correct folder when you try and run the file. or is it installed in ROOT/APPS/TEAMVIEWER.....  also teamviewer is in the repro's, why are you manually installing?
i want to open on every machine. thats why it is portable. my friend does not allow me to install it on his machine.
also teamviewer has a *.deb package on their website, if you NEED 8.
what you mean with: "or is it installed in ROOT/APPS/TEAMVIEWER....". this is a portable version.
so you want a poratble version like the windows version?.  the paths in the link you gave are root locations aka not based in your home folder
<unconvertable> should put it on my /home/username/ folder? why? <unconvertable> get all permissions of /apps already.
it is just strange to need to put it there, then own the directory, when you can simply run it from your home folder with no permission issues.. Tell me slowly again what you want to do
here the latest version of my explanation: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5845337
So i just got my EeePC today, fired up download for UNR and installed it and hit a monstrous brick wall. neither my ethernet nor wireless work
what model?
Attansic ethernet and Atheros AR9285 Wireless. I'm told the latter can be done with a kernel upgrade. 1008HA. ^
ahh yes that required a kernel module to be compiled, helped somebody through that before
i'm fine with a little kernel hacking but it's the attansic i'm worried about, i don't see that anywhere
the what?
the ethernet card. as in the hard line version
oh that, hold on i have a guide up for the 1008ha
because getting kernel sources etc. would be a PitA without internet of any form
do you have a usb drive handy?
somewhere...
well you are going to need it ;)
got an idea for the ethernet card?
yes there is a driver available
oh goodie, .deb maybe?
of course not, that would make things too easy
true, can't have that happening...
if you have another computer with the same exact kernel version, you can use that to compile the driver
unfortunately pretty much all my computers are amd64 at this point...
hi guys. why I am able to remove a file in my home dir , whereas this file is not mine ?. that's happen only with files in my home
because removing a file needs no more permission than write access to the containing folder. Ownership and permissions of the file are irrelevant.
I don't have write right on it.  I cannot reproduce it in /tmp
hello all. what version of nodejs does the pkg 0.10.25~dfsg2-2ubuntu1 provide on 14.04.3 ?. Its confusing. apt-cache showpkg nodejs doesn't give a specific version no. does the nodejs pkg provide the server/binary as well ?
node.js 0.10.25
does that pkg version actually mean 0.10.. or 10.0.. ?
0.10
on centos, when I install, it says nodejs-6.10.3-1.el7.x86_64. this pkg gives the binary for dev server also. is 0.10.25 far away from 6.10.3 ?
Ubuntu 14.04 will have whatever was the latest stable version when 14.04 went into package freeze. Sometime in early 2014
I'm confused between version numbers for concern about compatibility. but 14.04 is still getting update(s) ? so, it'd have some updated version now ?
only security updates and bug fixes, it won't get any upgraded version
is 0.10.25 far away from 6.10.3 or somewhere close ?
node.js used a different versioning scheme before the io.js split
ah, their room is invite only. how far is it in version ?
0.12.x was the last version before the split, and when they merged back together, they started on 4.0.x, using semver.  Hm? #node.js is not invite only.  anyway, again, The node.js version in Ubuntu 14.04 is what was the stable node.js version in early 2014
how about npm
same, whichever npm version was stable at the same time
Node.js 0.10.3 2013-04-03 3.14.5.8 1.2.17 0x000B. 2013! ?. Is there a way to get a more later version on 14.04.3 ?. to get around 6.10.3 version, which supports 3.x npm
you can always grab a precompiled tarball of nodejs 6.x, extract that somewhere, and specifically use that for the application in question
I could ?. there's prebuilt ones ?
First off how do I file a bug?. I'm getting this error here when I try to play any videos: The parameters passed to the application had an invalid format. Please file a bug!

ive got install python 2.7 and python 3.2 in my system (ubuntu 12.04). when i download a package it installs it automatically on python 2.7 and i cant find it on python 3. how do i uninstall python 2.7. ?
do not uninstall 2.7, you need them both
how do i make it work in python 3 also?. all my packages go to 2.7
if that .py script is not written for 3.2, it will fallback to 2.7, there are slight diff between the two languages
yes i know but i downloaded the latest version for python 3.2
you can force to run a scriupt like this >> " python2.7 /path/to/script" or "python3.2 /path/to/script"
and where do i force this run?

hello, how do I disable all my ppas ? do I also have to uninstall everything that comes from a ppa ?
You don't have to, but it is a good idea as you won't get updates for such software anymore
is the "Y-my-ppa" (or smth like) software a good way to do so ,. ?
Not even sure what that is.  You can use ppa-purge to remove PPAs and simply use apt-get to remove software
and by the way thanks for the advice yesterday, dd worked just fine. t
Oh, good to hear
I know but how do I check which software comes from ppa and so on ?
k .. i'll just do it the hard way ... what should i use to compile and write stuff?
thats a question of flavor
does gedit sense c++ ?

Are you looking to install Ubuntu?
yeah. nothing happens, it's like the grub/bootloader/whatever it's called is just tellng me what im telling it to do instead of doing it

whats the best program for viewing/managing photos including raw format
I like F-Spot, but you can use Picasa if you are familiar with it. It has a Linux version now
how do you view pics at 1:1
1:1 ? Don't understand
most viewer programs allow you to view the picture in actual pixels.  full size.  i can get f-spot to do that.  i can zoom in but it doesnt tell me at what percentage its showing me the pic in
good question, I never noticed that. That's something that should definitely be included

I am trying to install Ubuntu on an old laptop. It needs non-pae, so I am using netinst-12.04. But when it should start downloading packages, it just shows a blank screen (the ubuntu color). syslogs last message is "Good signature from Ubuntu Archive automatic Signing Key". What's wrong?
you don't state the age of your "old" laptop, but you might find lubuntu or xubuntu a better choice. the former is optimized for older hardware
The problem is that it needs a non-pae installer. Where to get the one for Lubuntu? I didn't find it.. *-installer +kernel

anyone having audio problems in Chrome on 12.04LTS?
what kind of problems
no audio on videos. works fine in Firefox
on a specific website or everywhere?
all video flash / html5. @ any ideas?
if you start a video in chrome and then open your sound prefs and select the Applications tab, do you see chrome listed in there?
@kostdon: hmmm let me check. @ no, it is not listed
hmm
@ it was working fine, did some auto updates and its stopped working. @ thinking it was an oss update
?!!?!.  have you by any chance installed oss or tried to configure your sound somehow?
nope. @ oss is installed but has been for a while
do you now the reason?.  why it was installed.  maybe it was a dep for something else, do you remember
think it was for using my usb condensor mic. i can uninstall and see if that works. @ checked in Synaptic... oss is not installed so must be an Alsa problem?
possibly
is it possible to revert to Alsa that was used before update?
do you remember what packages were updated?
no. i just said update all
how long ago. Maybe it's still in the dpkg.log
last week. should be, where is the log located?
in a terminal, give: gedit /var/log/dpkg.log
k, brb. @ only audio related update was Pulse Audio on the 18th. has to be the culprit
hmm right. in a terminal give: ps -A pulse do you get any output?
@ get a sytax err, should there be a | grep in there?
lol sorry, yeah, it should be ps -A | grep pulse
k. @ output // 2417 ? 00:29:00 pulseaudio
ok
@ is there a way to downgrade PulseAudio?
no need to, but you could reset it, by doing the following: pulseaudio -k then: rm -rf ~/.pulse and finally: pulseaudio -D
k
close all the apps that are capable of producing audio before doing it
@ what about system sounds?
not it's ok. actually the apps that are currently connected to pulseaudio, like e.g. if you are have a media player running or an flash vid in firefox
@ ok will let you know what happens. @ output// E: [pulseaudio] main.c: Daemon startup failed.

hiya. my gnome background image doesnt show anymore. anyone know how i can get it back. looks like the desktop broke, i get no icons on it or anything
hmm... sounds like your desktop manager went kersplat
maybe. panels are all working
you using regular gnome?
yep. i think i deleted some stuff on the desktop today.. but i didnt think that mattered
try running gnome & from a terminal.  the ampersand is important
gnome is already running though
ok... restart it.  do you have panels?.  those things at the top and bottom of your screen.  they're white by default
hrm its back now.... all that stuff was fine . just the desktop didnt appear. the actual jpg image, and none of the icons. panels and applications all ran fine @_@. anyway seems to be back to normal now so cheers :)
::nods:: gnome probably flaked out for some reason... did something the kernel didn't like... so it killed then restarted it... probably just took awhile to take effect
hehe

How do i tell if my laptop is broadcasting on wireless n?
you should be able to single click the wireless icon near the clock and click 'connection information'.  it'll tell you the speed youre currently connected with, but mind you, that might be lower than the maximum available depending on the quality of the link. sometimes wireless links will drop to a slower speed if the quality is low.
speed shows 54 Mb/s I guess its G....  how can i tell if my laptop can handle wireless n?

Query: anyone have any good tutorial on how to move /var/log and /var/cache to another partition?
assuming you're moving /var/ to another file-system: prepare the partition and file-system, reboot in Recovery mode, go to root shell, "mount -o remount,rw /", "mkdir -p /mnt/var", "mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/var" "mv /var/* /mnt/var/", "umount /mnt/var", add an entry in "/etc/fstab" for /var that points to the UUID of the new file-system, reboot and test. !info vdrift
thanks for the info.. Hmm.. Looks like I have to adapt that since I'm planning to move /var/logs to a zfs dataset.
Yes, I have separate LVs for /var/ /var/cache/ /var/logs/ and /var/cache/apt/archives and some other
I assume by LV you mean LVM/BTRFS "logical volumes"?

no problem... just waiting in the background to see if anyone could help :)
I don't really know much about configuing grub you may want to ask the poeple in #grub
I've worked hard to try to figure out by myself.... but the real problem is I don't understand why the system hangs after the addition of the swap file but it dosen't when I boot in recovery mode :O
I'm not sure. How fair does it get when it hangs?
I think I would have to shoot a video...
Yeah that might be a pain.
it is exactly after we see ''Adding 8388604K swap on /dev/sda1. Priority:-1 extents:1 accross:8388604K''. during the boot process
I take sda1 is the root?
nop its the swap partition
can you help me setup vsftpd?. I'm having trouble making virtual users uploading files
have you read the docs in /usr/share/doc/vsftpd ?
yes....  I read it, but still cant figure out why I cant upload files.  I'm using he virtual user configuration
quick question - I unzipped the tar, and it created a folder on my desktop. It's the new firefox 1.0.5. When I click on the installer, it tries to install it to the desktop. What directory should I install it to?
programs YOU install go in /usr/local/bin
ok, so move it there?
hi there!. Anyone here do any web page design? I've kind of run into a snag..
What's wrong?
it's actually just a stupid problem. I've been working with HTML and whatnot but it's to do with images
Out with it, already :P
It's creating an image that will let the background show through it. like transparency. I thought it would be simple enough, but i cant fiure it out
You using CSS?
I've tried GIMP, photoshop, fireworks..

how do I auto-load ethernet drivers for my card?. it is DEC 21041 chipset
you need to modprobe the module for it at boot.  well, any time really
I did a rmmod and modprobe but my pc hangs after tht
do you have another pc available?
the problem is lunix loads the Tulip drivers.... yes.
can you hit alt + F<something> to drop to command line and read dmesg.  if you are running sshd and have another nic up, you could connect via ssh (assuming its not hung it wel enough) and read dmesg | tail
yes..it shows the card as detected.. this is wht I get when I do lspci: nel modules: de2104x
can you restart x with the nic still drivered up and stuff?
well I searched and I found tht this driver does not work for this chipset.
i've done everything in th eofficial ubuntu guide and made sure that Xgl is installed but still cannot get Compiz to work...when i try to change the visual effects from none to normal or extra is says "The Composite extension is not available"
try typing compiz in a terminal, you'll get better error messages maybe
it's quite long, can i copy/paste it to you in a pm?
better is putting it on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org , if I don't recognize the error someone else might
http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/56805/. i notice it still says Xgl is not present...i coulda swore i just installed it
help :(

how do I show the IP-numer instead of URL in Firefox?
there is a /dns command available in more irc clients, you can use that '/dns www.google.com'
no in firefox

Hey guys, wanted to know: I have 14.04 install image (tried 64 and now 32 bit) and it won't install. On the THIRD SCREEN of installer, after the wi-fi setup, it asks if you want to download updates and install third party stuff. I choose both (or don't, tried two ways) and click continue, but it hangs right there.HP Pavillion DV6000
are you trying to install over wifi ? Can you try and plug ethernet in ?
no i'm installing from a USB drive and it has to connect to the net. i'm at work actually so there is no ethernet plug at the desk
ah. Are you connecting to the work wifi or something ?
yes, and it generally works, i've never had problems with anything (they keep it like a home wifi for guests because it's a hotel and we can't anticipate what services people _won't_ use so we have a wifi set up for general use)
is there a proxy on the wifi network ?
not that i know of. but like i said, i've tried this without the internet connect and it still hangs, so it can't be the internet. unless the code tries to connect if there is service or not, that's the only way i could say it's a network problem. (ie: if in the code it goes, "choose ethernet, if connected download, else download, next screen)
not sure then...I haven't installed Ubuntu over WiFi before.
i'm not installing over wifi. i'm installing with a USB drive. full install, and i've told it to not download things, but it still locks up
sorry, I meant using USB
oh, i thought it was the preferred method
i have modified my ~/.profile to have some custom things like ssh-agent and such auto-start ... now I'm getting an error like this: http://pastebin.com/YMcrz4Sg. anyone know how to supress this? or if there is a better place to put my startup scripts

nope its desktop trusty
no. you'd find it better to use something like rsync that picks up where you quit it. however do not pause it. or try to

Hallo!. I try to encrypt a partition with luks but it doesn't seem to work:. sudo cryptsetup -c aes-xts-plain -s 512 luksFormat /dev/sda2
I think you have to use -s 256 since it does it twice or something.  And you forgot what you want it named.  sudo cryptsetup luksFormat -c "aes-xts-plain" -s 512 /dev/sda2 LUKS01.  Or something like that.  it will show up in /dev/mapper/LUKS01
Sorry. It didn't work.

For lots of applications I get: error while loading shared libraries: liblzma.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. Ubuntu has no /usr/lib which seems to confuse the linker.. What's the idea behind that?
@ for liblzma.so.2, you probably just have to install the liblzma2 package. as for /usr/lib/, Ubuntu certainly does have it ...does your Ubuntu system not have /usr/lib ?. (that would be bad...)
and how do I get it?.  apt-get install liblzma2 => not found
@ what Ubuntu release are you running?
ah, right, it does have it..  I mean /usr/lib.  still no lzma.  is it in multi-verse or whatever it is that Ubuntu calls it?. ,liblzma2
@ sorry of you already said this, but what release of Ubuntu are you running?
Precise
gui or cli?
any.
I don't recall offhand, but I need to re-find it. do you use gmail or what?
how is my mail service provider relevant?.  I find it annoying when people ask for irrelevant details.
it is not irrelevant, the guide I know of assumes gmail and it may not work for other providers.
show me the guide and I will decide on that myself.
gladly
next time just say 'for gmail do URL'.
its the only one i am aware of, so again, no reason for bein that specific.
are you ever going to post the URL?
as soon as I find it.
is there anything else to try?
: compile your own kernel, get the source drivers from nvidia and be assuered it will always work

I use Spotify through Wine but it stops playing tunes after a couple of tracks, why? The player doesn't start but it works a couple of times before it stops.
have you checked appdb.winhq.org?
Ni, I'll.. *No.  Platinum rating in Wine HQ.
interesting
And no bugs related to my problem.
hmm :/
I use UFW firewall. But if that was a problem Spotify wouldn't start at all?
I don't know
start playing at alla, I mean-.  Ok.
hi guys, having a weird font problem when viewing websites in firefox ever since i installed 10.10, the font is barely readable - any ideas?. on xchat for instance, the font is just great

hi I have a quick question. I get this error. Error writing /home/lxcuser/.config/lxc/default.conf: No such file or directory. What is incorrect? It is the users own home directory...
type ls -ld /home/lxcuser/.config/lxc/default.conf
ls: cannot access /home/lxcuser/.config/lxc/default.conf: No such file or directory. oh hi  :)
hi  :)
I am trying to follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPk7EL1jja4 actually. trying to create lxc. I need to create 3 different unprivilaged configs.  so what should be the permissions for this user?
the file isn't created, try touch /home/lxcuser/.config/lxc/default.conf
cannot touch. I can do so with my admin account. is that a good idea?
no
I dont want to mess permissions even more. yeah its still complaining about the absence of the file
you dont have to be smart to wreck a system but you'd have to be terribly stupid to try :)
thanks for all the help! now running at 610
that took sometime didnt it? :) everything working ok?
hey, im having a problem getting an atheros ar242x to work under ibex. ive followed 2 guides at the suggestion of other users, but both fail to work
-> you have the correct drivers loaded?
not sure, both guides give different drivers
-> which one did you use though?
one says use ath5k and the other is something like ath_pci
Bonez, you need to download the linux-headers for your version of kernel. i think it's easiest to just 'sudo apt-get install linux-headers-686'. which should keep you updated with matching headers from now on. then re-run the vmware install
ahh silly me. thanks for that :).  sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r` worked a treat
i think if you use 'linux-headers-686' that's a meta-package, and will update for you when the next kernel comes out and so forth. so you don't have to manually get the latest exact kernel header version each time
Hi guys, whenever an application uses the wifi on my machine it lags untill its stopped -- like my machine will be really jumpy the mouse laggy and it doesnt stop untill firefox finishes loading the page, this also happens with apt so its not a FF prob,.,. anything that uses the internet causes it,. cpu spikes to 60%-100% -- what can cause this and is there a fix?
bodsda what kind of cpu and how much ram?
amd 64 18ghz 1.5 gig ram and plenty of free hard drive space
hmmm maybe you have an irq conflict although it is very rare. nowdays. what wifi chipset?
dunno,how do i find out?
bodsa are you using a laptop or what? do you know if your wifi is on board or pci?

hi. the mac address allocated by ubuntu to eth0 and wlan 0, is it safe enouth to keep as it is? or is it recommended to change to custome?. help. !ibus | zee313
the mac address is set on the card not by ubuntu.  do you mean the ip address?
i see. no i mean mac address

so my mac address for my wlan and eth comes assigned from the manufacturer?
mac addresses are hard coded into the cards by the manufacturer.  yes
okay. thanks.
Hi!. Is there a way to check when a new update was available.. All I can see from synaptic is the version name, I want the date as well.
i guess looking with a browser on the repo and the timestamp when the package was created is one way, another is "apt-get changelog packagename" but when it was installed on the system is not that easy to find out, only with parsing logfiles
No I don't mean when it is installed, I can see it from apt/synaptic.. I want to see when a package was released, preferably without going to package maintainers' website
apt-get changelog packagename
It displays the same text from synaptic.
and what is wrong with that information?
It does say the package version, yes, but not when it was released/made available.
-- Adam Conrad <adconrad@ubuntu.com> Fri, 27 Apr 2012 10:17:02 -0.  that is the changelog from vim, is 27.04.2012 10:17:02 not enough?
Actually, let me try that with another package.
the changelog-syntax is always the same for every package

Are you able to fix it temporarily?
?
Or do you have to close the whole program

stupid question: how can i configure the fonts wxgtk2 uses? bittorrent looks like some retro-game *g*
built against gtk1?. lik it uses huge-ass non-aa'd fonts?
looks like that.
Where can I find the window manager scripts that are executed when a user logs in? (plasma, gnome, xfce, etc)
I think you can to Control Center, or Settings Manager, look for Startup applications, and add it manually. Typically it gives u a dialoge box with 3 text boxes, to choose a Name, Description and command (Suggest to simply the absolute/full path of the command/binary/script) tat you want to run at login
Thanks, but the specific problem is that if I launch "Plasma" manually it works, but if I login to it from sddm the X server goes black during initialization.  XFCE login from sddm works, so I believe the problem is with the plasma "start" script executed by SDDM. I just don't know where to find it.
Ok, I am not a KDE user, can't help much with that, hopefully someone else in this forum might, wait and see if someone replies, tx
Found it, finally. /usr/share/xsessions
hey guys, where would i have to ask questions about nvidia related graphics card stuff?

how can I disable eth1 persistantly? I know I can do ifdown eth1, but that doesn't persist across reboots.
if you have external usb simplliy make it up ignore eth1 then
I don't understand
why you are trying to do so
exxon, I have eth0 and eht1. At one point, I enabled eth1, but now I don't need it and services keep running on eth1.  so I want to disable it so everything will run on eth0

I'm trying to compress a folder into a .tar.xz file while passing some custom parameters to xz. I made an intermediate .tar, but xz doesn't seem to want to compress anything. It looks like it's always trying to decompress, because no matter what I feed it, I get this error: "xz: File format not recognized". I've tried various flags, and settled with -kt9z. -z should force compression, but either it's trying to decompress anyway, or it wants something specific.. I've also tried doing it through stdio as the manpage demonstrates, but the example doesn't work for me.. Can someone do me a favor, and try to compress a file with xz on 12.10, and let me know if it works?. Does xz have a file size limit?
shouldn't do as far as I know
It doesn't like my 32 GB tar archive.

I'm curious as to what I did to cause this problem, as I've never run into it on previous versions of Ubuntu..  but then again I'm tinkering around more than I used to.
did you see my last pm ?
Yes. What does that do, exactly?
it adds the public key to your trusted keys
Is there something that I did to make that necessary?
hey. I don't understand how to build the java packages. I have installed java-package, but how to us this scripts?

Is there a way to change the local console message that you see after everything boots up? Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS <hostname> tty1 <hostname> login:
shure you can make it say anything
how? I don't believe its the /etc/motd. since you havent log into the system yet. I just want it to be completely blank when it ask for username and password

Thanks !, but this is after you log in. I'm talking about the screen that you see where it ask for your username and password.
what is the executable extension?
file types are not determined by extensions
well i just double clicked a .bin file and it said "rename this file to an executable extension"
dang the forums are offline. aptide is brainier :-). sometimes aptitude can install things that apt-get can't. !aptitude. ;-)
aptitude will install everything that apt-get will (no more) just that using aptitude will will install suggested packages automaticly where as apt-get wont
actaully yesterday I couldnt get something with apt-get and then was able to get it with aptitude
okey i used hotmail so it should be instant. check it out. slim how long are you gonna be on?
that's not an ip, that's a domain. ips look like 192.168.1.1 etc. type ifconfig and send me the output
yeah but it tied to a ip address. that should give you the samething. try to ping that and it will give the translation of what that is
yeah, once your applications are using more than physical mem, you enter swapping-hell, which is hard to get out of. If you disable the swap, the linux oom-killer (out of memory killer) will instead kill some processes when that happens, but you lose the ability to hibernate the system.
If you boot from SSD anyway, it doesn't matter too much..  lacking hibernate I mean.
well, booting from hibernation takes about the same time as booting fresh in my experience. The main point is that you get back the session you were in
hello guys I have a video sharing linux box, I love to know what people are uploading prior converting it. I know there is file and mimetype. I was wondering if you guys know a little accurate way of knowing what kind of file people are uploading. thank you in Advance
possibly mediainfo needs only the headers for certain type of files
I thank you so much. I'll work on what you have told me
and maybe ffmpeg can be abused for that as well
what do you mean abused ?.  can you expand it little bit.  I think you meant ffmpeg can tell me what kind of file is it am I correct ?
you need to know if the file, that is only partialy uploade is video file or not?is that right? or only prior to transcoding?. *uploaded
you are quite right.  and I am using actually ffmpeg to convert my files.  so in this case what can I do with ffmpeg to find out what the people are uploading
ffmpeg -i somefile should give you some clues.  what info do you need exactly?.  and why?
when the people start uploading I would love to know what they trying to upload is a video file, if it is video file, then let them upload it then use ffmpeg to convert it to *flv.  if not ignore their upload and send them a message
Hi, how do you make a TEST data iso (test cd) with mkisofs? Maybe make a test image first or something? TIA. hi. anybody here know how to make a test data iso?
what do you mean by "test iso"?

ok, is this just binary white noise?
yeah
dd if=/dev/zero of=file.out bs=1MB count=100
kewl
this creates 1 MB sized 100 files.  no, one piece file. sorry
so would i make 680mb or so
yes you can.  install dvd+rw-tools, and use dvd+rw-mediainfo to get the exact size of the disk
bs=680MB count=1 or just a bunch of files that add up to 680ish?

hi all, i found a PPA for getting php 5.3.10 on a 10.04 system. I used it as instructed, but in the end I didn't see any updates, I'm guessing it went to the official repos to get 5.3.3 binaries. I'm guessing this is because the unofficial PPA was meant for 10.04 and I am running 10.10? Is there a way to fake the PPA to give me the updates?. beign that 10.04 is so far out of updates, I'm guessing 10.10 and 10.04 are fairly convergent by now, no?
sounds like you've made a huge mess of your machine
don't think so it works fine... it just ignored the new ppa

can anyone tell me why unofficial backports thrived but when it became official it withered away?
because most people only used it for legally dodgy things like w32codecs. and the maintainers seem to have lost intrest. and breezy is about to be released

it will be inside already

what mouse and what connection type?
PS/2.  Other than that, i have no clue. It worked two days ago, and it works in Windows 98...
odd, and it works in windows you say?
Works in DSL, and on Knoppix... Just not in my fresh XORG.  Works in windows....  Unfortunately, Windows 98 doesn't support the wireless card I'm using, so I have to use Intrepid...
okay, you can try take a look at the DSL xorg.conf and check for differences regarding a mouse. Also can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf please

I'm back ... I was counseled to do a "rsync" to recover the information from my USB memory key. It has finally started to recover things from F4AA-1C19. But will it recover from directories on the usb key or will it just recover from the "root" directory?. sary: Do you remember my USB memory key problem from a couple hours ago? Eric^^ helped me by suggesting that I do a rsync to recover my data. But I don't yet know if the command will recover inside directories on the USB key or just the stuff on the main directory.  Hello. Do you remember my usb key problem from earlier? Will the command you gave me recover in directories inside the usb key or just on surface?
hey, yes inside the usb as well
So I should in the near future start finding /media/steve/F4AA-1C19/subdirectory/photo.jpg?
yeah.  you never deleted them did you?
Why would I have deleted something that I now want to recover at all costs?. ;)
it happens :D
And you mean that I hadn't deleted then recovered the things?
is it possible to mount a usb external hdd in Ubuntu? i think it is Fat32 or NTFS , some reason its not mounting,
i mount an ntfs external USB on a regular basis. ubuntu should have ntfs-3g installed from the get go, so all you should need to do is choose a mount folder and do the command. in my case it was: 'sudo mount /dev/sda1 /storage' and voila mounted in the folder /storage located in root dir
ok thanks ill try that

very random question: I'm on the x86 version of 8.10. What are all the lib64 packages for?. Just curious :)

well they're not installed on my system. I was just wondering what they were used for. Mostly being curious :)
I need some insight on how library version numbers work on Ubuntu. For instance, I have the package "libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio 1.2.14-6.1ubuntu3". Clearly, it means libsdl 1.2.14 is installed. However, the library file it contains is "/usr/lib/libSDL-1.2.so.0.11.3". Where does the 0.11.3 come from ?
probably a symlink
"/usr/lib/libSDL-1.2.so.0 -> libSDL-1.2.so.0.11.3". "/usr/lib/libSDL-1.2.so.0.11.3: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped"
apt upgrade or apt full-upgrade. which do you prefer?
doesn't matter. your box, your choice.
yes. but which is less troublesome and more favored by the master developers?. someone recommends: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -f
1. no "master developers" here. 2. if you are unsure what the commands do, read the man pages.
why don't the masters come here?
anyways, it is all a big pile of unstable crap :D
stop that

Okay, an easier question: How do I go into recovery mode in Lucid? It doesn't display the GRUB boot menu.
press left shift once grub started
I just did that. I didn't get the recovery mode though.
dans: you would have to restore the headers of that file more or less by hand, really not a nice job
Unless recovery mode still attempts to load the nvidia drivers. I installed nvidia-xconfig and now I get a black screen where before I was running in low resolution.
.. and only if there is no new data , dans.  : or run sudo init 1, it'll bring you there , too, maybe your grub is configured to not display these kernel-lines ?
I can't run anything because nothing is visible on the screen
ctrl+alt+F1 ?
I can see the login prompt flash for about a tenth of a second and then it goes black for 5 seconds, and it repeats.  tried that too. No response. I'll reset the xorg.conf using the live cd i guess. And hopefully a distribution upgrade from 10.04 LTS will take me to 11.04 without any serious issues
do you get the boot-menu at all on left shift ?
I get nothing. I've tried holding down the key since hitting the reset button, or tapping it repeatedly. get the same result every time. i'm not too surprised that 10.04 LTS can't support the newer hardware. But I was a bit surprised that installing 11.04 didn't work at all. I suppose I could burn a third CD and install 10.10 ... >_<
i learned about a nice command to find out which ubuntu version (codename) you have, the other day. i forgot it, and now i dont have web access. Anyone?

lsb_release -a , without the 's' xD
not that one, it was a cat of a proc file or something, but i'll try yours!
don't know xD
well whaddayaknow, i now have dapper
update-rc.d sucks sucks sucks
it is not supposed that you use it.  its a package manager backend
well, I don't really feel like creating the symlinks manually...
not for system administration
perhaps I meant to say that sysvinit sucks :)
adding and removing symlinks is the right way
bootmisc.sh is probably run way too early in the boot so I need to create a "late" init script
update-rc.d will overwrite all changes on next update.  and revert them .....
ouch
what i said :) not for admin stuff
but it doesn't revert manually created symlinks. ?
exact
ok. hmm, debian doesnt't seem to have chkconfig either
hmm, debian isnt gentoo or redhat ;).  neither slack.....
perhaps I should file a bug in bugzilla suggesting addition of rc.local that is run as the last thing in boot
JDahl: scroll back and read my conversation with  ;)
4) Next, link the new local file by running the following command in a console:. update-rc.d local start 80 2 3 4 5 .. http://www.desktop-linux.net/debian-rclocal.htm. they seem to suggest using update-rc.d manually...
that doc seems wrong...who wrote it ?
no idea, the web page doesn't say
hmm.  as i said, you can use it, but will loose all changes on next update
but frankly, this is the first time i heard update-rc isn't meant for end users, so it's kinda underdocumented
it is just a misuse that has been documented by ppl that didnt know better..... the clean way is add/remove symlinks
I think the easiest way would be rc.local a'la redhat + others.  so that newbies wouldn't need to think of sysvinit at all

[ 9.115] (II) modeset(0): Output DP-2 disconnected
well at least the are getting recognized, you may have some key sequence or something to enable them idk
ok, cool, thank you
have you checked system settings/display and see if they show up there
is anyone here familiar with Trouble Ticketing?. what is the best framework for trouble ticketing to be chosen for a company?
rt is very common.  it's what canonical's sysadmins use, and its what we use where i work

nope.  i am going to try to manual install it
you can type a folder where to install it and you should know where
I just booted up my computer to find that Unity and Skype had somehow un-installed themselves. Both of them had completely disappeared, I have got them back now, I re-installed them. Why would this have happened? I'm running 15.04 with a clean install 3 days ago.
maybe you removed a package and it removed unity?. like removing lightdm removes ubuntu-desktop too
That's the thing though, I didn't remove anything.
check /var/log/apt/history.log. maybe it got removed somehow
I'll take a look... this is just so peculiar.. I found the culprit, I wish I could see the user who initiated the command: "apt-get remove python"
can ubuntu write in NTFS or only read ?
just read
ohk...
all linux can just read, not just ubuntu.
there is no way to write ?
not one that's stable. It's because we're having to reverse engineer the ntfs filesystem.
ok thanx  ?. *!

include them in your ini @ smashcat?. smashcat: then restart php?
It has the extension directory pointing to the right place. Restarting apache makes no difference.

Could someone help me out with the installing of my propitary ATi drivers? SH gives me an error when I try to run the installer.
System > Administration > Hardware Drivers
There are none listed. So I got the one from ATis site downloaded
what card do you have?
An ATi Radeon X850XT
sorry to tell you but your card's support has been dropped by the latest release of ati's drivers
Yes but this is the 9.3 that I have downloaded. It says that it's compitable with my card.  The latest release is 9.5
only 9.4 or 9.5 drivers will work with jaunty

Hi, is there something like winrar for linux? I've got a giant database that I want to zip up and break into pieces. Thanks. like a command line tool, i mean
use tar/gzip? tar can do splits. split can split files too
great, thanks.  that's what i'm looking for
i wouldn't use gzip if the database is not well compressible
no? why not?
anyone here familiar with gnome?
installed it on my laptop last night, i really like the minimalistic layout.
I'm using an external display so I set "workspaces_on_primary_only" to false. but when I connect/disconnect the display, it all goes to the primary one
i manage my monitors via the Display app.  ive never had to mess with any conf
when you press the home key do they all go to the same screen?
i think so, i dont have the laptop with me at the moment
that's what I don't want. I want the windows on the external display to go to that display. not to the main one
maybe gnome-tweek-tool has something that can help?
already tried that. it resets whenever I unplug

no luck?
the thing is, when I disconnect the monitor, it reverts back to all windows on the same screen
okay i just did apt-get install linux-images blabla a new kernel.. said yes to lilo, so i guess all i have to do is reboot?
it should have kept your previous kernel as "ubuntuOLD"
so i should get a lilo menu now?
it won't do any harm to "sudo lilo" first - just to make sure
Added Linux *. Added LinuxOLD
I nearly had a heart attack when, after removing the 2.6.10 kernel it tried to run grub! Last time it ran grub, I couldn't boot anything for about the next 12 hours....  the '*' is the default

Its an usb flash drive of 4 GB. I will just reformat it

that is not normal, and, yes, it is a problem

hey, I have libffi-dev installed, but GNUstep's ./configure is still moaning that it can't find libffi, is it in a special place, or did I install the wrong package?
if that was what the readout said was missing it should be able to locate it
http://paste.lisp.org/display/111529 < <unconvertable> this is what gnustep-base's configure says. notably, it seems to be searching for ffi.h. which locate doesn't seem to think exists
interesting..it does say incomplet support for ffi... did you try the configure with the --wity-ffi-include.  rather --with-ffi-include
well locate can't find an ffi.h. so...

Is there a "neater" way of doing the following? (Find all files below the current directory which do not end in gz, and tail them). find -type f | grep -v gz$ | xargs tail -F
use grep -i -v [files you want to leave out].  Scratch that. Misread.
I know "find" itsself can do a lot of cool stuff, but I tend to mostly pipe its output out to grep and things. like the pipe to xargs there
Hey, just installed Virtualbox (not OSE, 2.2) and can't find it in the menu or execute it via terminal?
afaik it should turn up in the system menu.  but you should be able to run it from a terminal.. try running VirtualBox in a terminal.. (caps is needed)
Ah really, never knew that, no wonder I found it hard to find in synaptic before
oh.. I'm not sure if the synaptic search box is case sensitive.. but when running stuff from the terminal you need to use the right case.. (which in most cases are lower case)
Sweet man, I'm all good now, thank you very much :)

Hi im about to setup a raid array and mount it in a non-standard location. I want it to get remounted on boot - how do i manage the setup of the array on boot?
doesent mdadm assemble it for you automatically?
im not sure is there a init script that does it on boot?. In the (far distant) past (not on ubuntu) i wrote my own startup script
do you need it on boot? or is after boot ok?
after is fine.  perhaps before fstab get read?
well if you have a configuration file for mdadm, it will assemble the array for you automatically. Then having it in fstab, it will mount.  i havent used mdadm for a while. Just do raid with servers. And then i prefer hardware raid..  i believe mdadm will be called automagically before fstab
heh not in my budget :).  ok cool
yeah same for me I guess if i would ever want it on something wich is mine. Make sure to enable mailing so you get status updates on how your array is doing.
i'll give it a shot - box is in use atm so i didnt really want to test with a reboot.  reading the manpage you look spot on though

Hi. I am trying to restore my EFI partition (accidentally deleted) with boot-repair. Boot-repair tells me to create a an EFI partition with boot, which I did, but then is unable to recognize the partition. How do I fix this? thanks!
did you set its partition type code as ef00 ?.  (i don't know how to restore it, though)
i tried using the hex code in fdisk (much longer than ef00) and it showed up as "EFI". do I need to explicitly use this ef00 type?
i think you should use gdisk, not fdisk
ok, how do I set code as ef00 though?
under Code column you should see EF00
ok I did it. ill try boot-repair again now
in gdisk "t change a partition's type code"
yes I did it.  but boot repair still doesn't recognize this partition. 1 2048 411647 200.0 MiB EF00
sorry i don't know how to restore it. somebody else can probably help. maybe grub-install would work(?)
thanks anyway.  but would grub-install restore the EFI files and everything?
no idea
actually I think mounting the EFI partition and running grub-install was all that was necessary.  I will try to reboot now
hi i am having a lot of trouble getting a bcm4312-lp wireless card to function properly
wht is the problem
the card is listed in ifconfig and I see modules for it in lsmod, but I don't see any wireless networks listed. and I definitely should.
you may need to download the firmware
I've made sure it's not blocked by rfkill, it was listed as being blacklisted in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf but I commented it out
look for the firmware put it in the appropriate place and then remove and reinsert the driver module
I have the firmware downloaded for it using firmware-b43-lpphy-installer
ok
this is part of the output of my dmesg : b43-phy0: Loading firmware version 666.2 (2011-02-23 01:15:07)
ok did you reinsert the driver module
yes I think so. I did modprobe -r b43 && modprobe b43
ok .. seems like you're fine ... are you not able to use the device still
RIGHT, so that's why I'm sitting here scratching my head. It isn't the hardware switch.
hmm ..
no, the device shows up, the modules are loaded, but I see no wireless networks and I should see plenty. There's a wireless router about 2 feet from this machine.

ok, first I got error /proc/mounts/ does not exist while trying to update-grub, so I mkdir. Now I get this error 'Cannot find list of partitions!'. os-prober give the same error. What should I do?
are you doing this within a chroot ?
yes.
that's why it won't work, why are you doing it in a chroot ?
eh? Because I'm using a LiveCD, and I want to update-grub on my hard-disk partition... I did wrong?
what guide are you using. ps -ef | grep application name. the user running it is on the left
<>, this --> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#Recover%20Grub%202%20via%20LiveCD
did you do the mount bind ?
mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev? yes :)
ok, now do the same for /proc
is it `mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc?
sounds good
i got this error --> mount: mount point /mnt/proc does not exist :(
make it
"Cannot find list of partitions!" T__T
chroot into the system and do "mount" and pastebin the output please.
which system?
the one you're trying to fix grub on
http://paste.ubuntu.com/395227/
you've got proc mounted 2 times within the chroot
I'm not sure how to solve that.
inmount the wrong one. nope

okay I don't have anything like that
well it is occasionally useful...just left click nm-applet and create wireless network....well that used to work, seems broken now

which ubuntu is this? ubuntu-gnome or which?.  or normal ubuntu with gnome

hmm, not 100% sure about 12.04 but i do believe you're missing that directory.  altho i don't think thats the exact problem here
is that direcotry important? :P
it can be. but the nexessary settings are still set so it should be ok..  i'm wondering if the cgminer guide you used set some envvars thats messing up everything.
it had a couple of export display lines i didn't like the look of..
normally cgminer is ran on a headless server, and most guides would be written to facilitate this. it could be that the cgminer config has messed up your system
I guess it's true what they say "greed kills" :P.  damn. can't i reinstall everything display related?
without knowning the scripts you used did then i can't say for sure if that will fix anything
what can I do then?
i'm in a dir that got deleted and created how do i "refresh" it withoute doing cd ..; cd mydir
What's wrong with "cd ..; cd mydir"? You can also do: cd "$PWD"
what if it is a long path?
Then 'cd "$PWD" ' should still work.
indeed thanks ;0. :)

I managed to get it installed using netboot (no cd drive, no support for usb booting) but I'm having trouble getting Xorg going... this machine has a very old intel integrated card... I appear to have KMS working, but starting X just results in a black screen, and even magic sysrq cannot reboot the machine...lspci says the card is "Intel 82830 CGC", How can i get xorg goi
you might be able to adapt this information: http://www.insidesocal.com/click/2010/02/intel-82830-cgc-830m-graphics.html
thanks.  disabling modesetting is really not a solution. Then again, perhaps i'm asking in the wrong place. ubuntu user's arent known for being the most well-advised.
well, does it work with vesa
one moment..  does not appear to work with vesa, when the kernel is started with nomodeset
humm, i expected it would work
sec
can somebody gimme default 10.04 repository list?. so can somebody gimme default 10.04 repository list?. !repository. !repositories

from grub menu , press (ii think its) F5 or F6 and choose safe gfx
thanks, let me check it

what's the procedure for replacing dhclient3 with dhcpcd?
apt-get does that on its own iirc
it doesn't uninstall dhclient, which is used before dhcpcd
so uninstall it manually
then network-manager is uninstalled, which kills networking altogether.  ubuntu ships with 4 dhcp clients, but there appears to be no documented way of actually using anything other than dhcp3-client
Hi, is there any way to convert xml files to .ods (Openoffice spread sheet)?
i imagine that there is some python libs in the repos to deal with openoffice.  if you are comfortable with creating python shell scripts then you could simply create a nautilus script to convert it
thanks, i will check it :)

isn't there any way in karmic to change login window theme?
go to system>admin>login window
that doesn't show how to change the theme
it does. look harder
and its login screen, not login window as it used to be till jaunty
?.  go to local in that and chagne theme
i don't see any "login window" in my karmic's system > admin, i see "login screen" and it doesn't allow me to change theme, it just allows me to enable/disable automatic login and change timeout
aah sorry karmic yeah its not possible.  damn.  because the gdm is separate now :(.  dont know this one
yup.. but there should be a way to do it..

Hello there, I am trying to extract a file but it says , "tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors". I tried almost everything of what I could but getting it everytime.
what does `file` think about the file? Is it compressed? Are you passing the right options to tar?
git_think.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Wed Jul 23 06:04:30 2014
right, so gzip compressed tar file. How exactly are you trying to extract it?.  tar -xf should technically auto-detect the compression and do that for you,.  else try tar -xzf git_think.tar.gz
first I tried tar -xvzf file, then I tried "tar -xzf file"
if that doesn't work: make sure the file isn't compromised / broken (e.g. due to a faulty download. See if there is an md5 sum or something you could use to check).  try -xf, recent versions of tar should, in theory, auto-detect the compression.  if that doesn't work, chances are that the file is a bit broken (if other .tar.gz files work fine)
tried -xf, it is giving no response from long time, I have not stopped, it seems like doing something in background, but as it has been enough time I doubt it
add the file after f :p.  tar -xf git_think.tar.gz
yes I added tar -xf file
if that does something: see if extracted files appear. if yes: good. If not: it might really be broken (the file). If you downloaded it: try re-downloading / check the md5sum or similar if available
before this .tar file , I ran this command on .txt file by mistake after it exited with same status, after that is same for .tar file too :(
hey anyone im trying to run gdesklets(from synaptic vs 0.35 on gutsy) and it gives me a blank gdesklets shell

hi, can i get some info about why i can't get X11 Forwarding to work from PuTTY?. it's just an "Error: Can't open display" when i run anything like xeyes
are you running X?
i'm connecting from windows. what do you mean running x?
you need to be running an x server on windows if you want to use X11 forwarding
i am
which one?
xming
did you enable it on the server?
yes, ssh_config and sshd_config both have all X11 forwarding options set to 'yes'
don't know then, never used windows for X11 forwarding.  make sure you restarted sshd after changing options in its config
alright. could it be i have my display variable set incorrectly?
what is it set to?
localhost:0:0 is what I have in putty for x11 forwarding to
try just "localhost:0"
ok. serverside and clientside?
somebody I need help with uninstalling crossover
how did you install it?
I honestly can't remember, I think I used some kind of package.  I know I didn't use apt-get
bah. If apt-get wasn't involved there may be no clean way to get rid of it again.
It's just that it's stuck in my Applcations menu bar and I want it gone
as an icon on the bar? Does just right-clicking the icon and saying "remove" not work?.  (I can't give you the exact wording, the install I'm currently in is not english)
I tried the command it gave me (/opt/cx/office/bin/cxuninstall as root).  and it gives me this: cxuninstall:error: unable to determine how to uninstall CrossOver Linux Professional.  and when I right click on it, it does nothing
really more of a crossover question than an ubuntu question if you didn't use apt-get or the like to install it....  if the icon doesn't respond to right-click I'm not sure what icon it is. Is it in the bar (panel) or is it inside the "applications" menu?
It is inside the Applications menu.  Oh don't worry I managed to work it out :).  but could you possibly help with one last thing
just ask the channel...
okay, thanks. how do I delete directories via kernel?
I don't follow. "via kernel"? What are you actually trying to do?
remove a directory, if I try to just right click and go remove it says I need the permission.  Don't I have to remove using a sudo command?
is there a good way to revert an upgrade? after installing yesterdays kernel update, my computer either locks up completely or crashes out and returns to a gdm login when the screensaver is activated or the computer goes to sleep
yes, during boot up use another the older one from GRUB list. another or* the older one
the problem is it was the same one i had installed
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean
i did a fresh intrepid install last week.. been using 2.6.27-7. yesterday the update pulled down linux-image-2.6.27-7-generic and all the related headers. there is only one entry in my grub list

do you see the grub menu ,  ?
: yes it appear the menu where we can choose to try Lubuntu then i say to try and the screen start to switch off and on , and it can start. On another hand trying Ubuntu , we can reach to the part we say to try Ubuntu. Iam using a usb persistent that work on my acer 5204 wlmi very well and on many desktops i tryed before. I a afraid to try a full install if i dont have sure it will work on it.. IS a friend of mine laptop.. where said can please read cant . typing mistake

Disk Mounter v. 2.30.0 in Maverick shows one Partition of my single internal hard disk with 2 Icons: Firstly "(not mounted)" and at the same time secondly as "(mounted)". Is this a bug? '~$ mount' shows it as mounted.
when it doubt trust the terminal
Right. But this answers my question only partially.
ploooop: Not to select one.. Reinstall it... Like I said, something fudged up.
yea, something with alsa and stuff.  should be somewhere in the repositories.  did you try sudo apt-get install alsa?
ploooop: Yes. I even tried removing it and reinstalling it. (I already have all the sound drivers, but I shut down VMWare inappropriately and it fudged up how Linux interacts with the sound card)
ahh, you're using vmware.  kinda problematic... when you're doing soundcards.  I never got it to run properly with my soundcard nor my video device
ploooop: No, I had it all fine, but when my computer froze, I had to reboot... After that, all the sound in linux is static while in VMWare sounds just fine.
10pm Tuesday here. Its hard living in the future :)

Hi, what could cause the LVM devices not to appear in /dev after reboot?. lvscan etc all recognises it. but the devices are not in /dev
did you only reboot or did you move disks to a new system?
reboot :)
and what device is missing exactly under dev?. the dm-* device?
well when I set it up I had the VG in /dev but now after reboot it's gone. but I now found it under /dev/mapper/vgname-lvname. so it's ok I guess
thats where is belongs =)
yeah just that LVM showed me fancy smancy /dev/vgname/lvname
Why are some third party sources at the end of /etc/apt/sources.list but other sources are added as separate files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ ???
that is a design choice.
So who decides which method is used for particular repos? I have third party sources in both places and it's a little confusing
from 12.04 and up /etc/apt/sources.list.d/, i think it is designed this way, to disable ppa's easily.
So I guess it depends whether I added the repo manually by editing sources.list or by adding it in the sources dialog?
just add it to the sources menu / dialog, that would add the key also, and put it in the right place.
I'm not trying to add a new repo, just trying to understand why they are in two different places

well i'm trying to play a cd and rythum box pops up but won't play
is it a cd with special copy protection; check the case
it is store bought but i dont have the case
is it every cd you own or just that one; what about ripping it to mp3 does that work, and if not what are the exact errors you get ---> paste.ubuntu.com with them
there are no error messages everthing pops up correctly it just doesn't play the songs and i'm not quite sure about mp3 I don't have one
no need to have a player, what happens when you try to rip the cd songs to mp3 format paste.ubuntu.com with the errors from that
how do i ripe it to mp3 format?
Hey, I'm trying to install the nvidia drivers, but they don't show up as option under "Additional Drivers". What should I do?
what gpu is it?
it's a macbook pro 10,1, so it has a dual GPU intel + NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M
install nvidia-319 what version of ubuntu is this?
Ubuntu 13.10. From the command line?.  nvidia-319, not nvidia-319-updates?
so i've got these 3 monitors lying around and they're making m think about building a triple headed system.... ideally what i'd like is to have compiz run a hexagon and show half of it at a time on the 3 displays. but i'm wondering: what happens when i spin it and the desktop that was on the 27" 1920x1080 display gets put on the 19" 1280x1024 display instead?
thats not how it spins
what do you mean?
compiz will have a very wide desktop and one desktop will go across all 3. you spin it, and you'll move to the next..  it wont move the contents of one monitor to the next monitor. all 3 monitors will change at once
oh. wild
this is why i hated multiple monitors when i used compiz
is their something more appropriate than compiz i should be using?
for 3d desktop? ehh... kwin can do 3d desktop but i dont know how it handles multiple monitors for that
i guess the 3d isn't essential, although i would hate to go back from at least using the gpu for compositing. back to the dark ages so to speak

not sure about authuserfile pointing to outside your hidden passwrd file, but you spelled "Require" wrong in last lien.  just like I spelled "line" wrong :-)
> yeah ok, i actually spelled it right on the server, the one i oasted was a fast type of, so thats not the problem.... > but what do you mean about the passwd file being somewhere wrong?
here's a tutorial on .htaccess .... http://www.freewebmasterhelp.com/tutorials/htaccess/3.  notice that the authusrfile points to the .htpasswd file you should place in the same dir with .htaccess
> what? should the .htpasswd be in the same directory? omg...
maybe not necessary but you need the correct path to it and it needs to be within the www user space.  when I've used it in the past, I've kept the 2 files together in the directory I wish to password protect
ok
here's the link to the online utility to create username/password pairs ... http://www.kxs.net/support/htaccess_pw.html

Hi, I installed Xubuntu-desktop, didn't like it so I uninstalled it with "apt-get remove". The xubuntu bootscreen is still there after reboot :( as well as the option to boot into xubuntu at login.. How do I remove this?
is it doing you any harm?
Not really, just worried it didn't uninstall correctly.
the packages i download dont do anything even after install and the last update i did for my system had one for the card but i knocked my internet completly out, wired and wifi (dont have wifi but still)
the connection was interupted *during* the update?
no it installed just fine as i have it set up to a wired connection but on reboot it wouldent even pick up the wired connection i checked the cable and there were no problems, i had to remove the package to get internet back
maybe try "sudo apt-get update --fix-broken" see if it will replace broken/missing parts..
topper is that the whole command?
... yes that's the whole command... it'll check for broken packages
topper alright, well i run my OS off of a USB (hardrive failure and its much cheaper) so ill try that out later, cause im on a desktop computer atm XD
k... good luck with it, it that command doesn't fix it, it won't make it worse....
topper thanks and if need be i have many back ups of my system so i can always reinstall if anything goes wrong
when i run uname -r and get 2.6.32-342-ec2 ... is that the latest kernel?. or do i need to run apt-get install linux-...3.0.16 etc?
dont bother. 3.xx is just a name
watcha mean?. i upgrade from lts to ocelot ... just making sure i don't need to change grub or install an update kernel
okay, so i added a /etc/init/foo.conf upstart script, and when i sudo service foo status, i get foo: unrecognized service. is there some additional step i need to perform to get upstart to recognize this new service?. (i know systemd requires a `systemctl daemon-reload`, but i was told here that upstart will recognize the new service automagically (which seems to not be the case based on my testing))
it's sudo status foo
that doesn't work either. status: Unknown job: foo
service is for sysvinit
service is also for systemd.. service is also a generic wrapper that calls your init's binary of choice.
thought it's systemctl
nope, service still works. for backwards compatibility.
like.. I have a tilt left on my scroll wheel.. I'm wanting to map it to be middle mouse button

I have a google-analytics.com entry in my /etc/hosts pointing to 0.0.0.0 but Chromium doesn't respect it?? Other browsers do.... Tried with another entry - trackersimulator.org refused to connect.. How come google-analytics.com trumps my hosts
isn't that a question for #chromium?.  it could be that google-analytics.com is handled by google differently
I thought Chromium is open source and free of any BS. Wrong?
does that prevent anything shady?. well, you can check the source code :). you haven't asked the chromium guys yet, or?. I'm a bit confused also
Alright, I'll ask them.... But as you say, it's Chromium really. Another thing:. When I try rebooting I get "logout cancelled by Viber", I am with KDE though :) Can you help with that?
not sure. is that a viber message?. hmm. maybe it's not easy to tell. I would ask in #KDE or #Kubuntu
https://i.imgur.com/JjPjr5d.png
found a bit of info here https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/5094. is that last comment on that page from you?
Yes. It doesn't seem to be a KDE problem https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3301.  furthermore - Brave also opens google-analytics.com. Vivaldi as well. Oh no, I copied the forwarded url... So only Brave
I just tried parted magic on two different computers.
still no luck?
It made the first one shut down out of the blue. Twice. The second one it is simply hung on the booting screen.. I could try it on this one, but somehow I have less than high hopes.. The only thing I've found that works every single time is partition magic, but unfortunately I can't find a torrent for that that is bootable.
i have used on three different machines
glad you have better luck.

I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm not Ubuntu Savvy 
when I try to add a row in iptables, it seems like it works (doesnt give an error), but than I do iptables --list , and i dont see anything. Any ideas? Here is the command I am using : iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 10000
I think that sudo iptables --list does not show the 'prerouting' table
correct
so your rule won't show up there :P
how do i add that table ?
To view it? Hang on
nm, think i got it.. its the nat table, and i googled how to view that table : iptables -t nat -L

ok as you all cant help me with my questio which is fine btw, can anyone point me to a reference for a red hat admins guide to ubuntu servers
huh? LOL!.  missed your question
ubuntu bit like windows keep changing stuff lol
oh my yes. It can be frustrating.. the whole init / upstart thing would be painful to an RHEL type
basically Im a red hat based server admin and Ive been asked to look at an ubuntu server thats borked but theres a few differences in locations service names stuff like that
LTS is for production. The regular distro is actually pretty bleeding edge.  what's the prob. exactly?
you cant get more bleeding edge than Fedora :D
yes but that is RPM ... ANATHEMA!
its just the thinks like no chkconfig I need an ubuntu guide for red hat users :D
you can install chkconfig but it doesn't work with everything
I know but this aint my box. and the problem is tty1 dies whenever you try to login
you can use update-rc.d
even if its using upstart for tty1 ?
udo update-rc.d -f daemon remove <- like chkconfig daemon off
arent all LTS .04
can somebody give me hand with my problem?
ask :-)
I just copied a bunch of files from a remote PC to my local PC .... both running ubuntu 8.10
Hi. Is there an easy way to make Thunderbird handle mailto-links from Firefox?. The default settings try to open a new Thunderbird each time, which is something Thunderbird doesn't like.
use the preffered apps in settings
Yes, I know that, but what should I put in there? The default "Thunderbird" setting is wrong because it tries to open a new Thunderbird each time I want to send mail.
It shouldnt do that, it happens to me sometimes
Do you use Thunderbird too?.  On Hoary? And is the line in your preferred applications "mozilla-thunderbird -mail %s"? (that's the default for TB)
yes. I use preffered apps and it works fine. but hold on let me give you a link
I'm guessing you know a script that does it right? I know about that solution... I was hoping that Ubuntu had made a neat package or something that takes care of it..  But if you have a link, please paste it. That should help.
this is probably a dumb question...but is there a way to forcibly de-swap everything? a lot of stuff fell into swap because of a runaway leaky process but i killed it so i'd like to bring everything out of swap once and for all rather than on demand
swappoff
thanks, i'll swapoff and then swap it back on

Hi, is there a program, or a way, to mess around with the functionality of a laptop's touchpad?

Thanks, these look really useful.

how do I make my synclient commands stick on boot?
you could add the commands in /etc/rc.local above the 'exit 0' line.  I suggest you suffix them with an ampersand so the boot doesn't hang
i'm not sure, is there a safer way so to speak?
why is it not safe?
if you say it can hang. I tried the X11 something, it's not working anymore it worked in the previous install for some reason

Ed: gmplayer says it was compiled without GUI options..
What determines what network interfaces show up in network-admin ?
perhaps what network cards you have in your computer
As well as my modems. But one of my modems doesn't show.
well it's probably a winmodem.
It's not a winmodem, it's a USB adsl modem. It works fine, but it doesn't show there.
Why does apt-get not show me the most recent versions on launchpad? Or is that not how it works?
the repos and ppas you have have told you the versions they have, they may not have the latest releases on
Can I add stuff? eg: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/i386/perl-base/5.12.4-2
Hello, are mount points just partitions? .... like having different partitions in Windows ?
not really.  as I understand it they are just a place to put the data so it can be seen in the tree, not separate from the partition they are mounted in
I need to do a network monitoring of disk space and usage......how do I find out then ?
well you can still check disk usage of mount points.  using commandline> du /mount/point.  man du for more info, its useful for disk usage (lol)
well the disk usage is gonna be done by a Network management system, I just need to setup the different areas to check
there are a bunch of net moniters out there also.  well mount points are viewed as part of the tree, when mounted, so shouldn't be too hard.  they show as if native to that disk.  in my experience)
ok, it's just that the NMS ask to setup in snmpd.conf, the different partitions, so I was looking to find them so I can add them
so it is monitoring based on partitions?.  not folders or files?
it monitors disk space, based on the partition (full size, used size....and sends alarms based on a percentage I will setup (<90%, for eg)
hmm in that case it may act different
here's the link http://www.opennms.org/index.php/Monitoring_disk_space_with_Net-SNMP
Hi. Is there a way to edit exif metadata for images?

wow. how many hours does it take for devede to convert an avi file to a video dvd?
<> wow. how many hours does it take for devede to convert an avi file to a video dvd? <--- I forget the exact length but it didn't seem to long for me. One thing, though. :| Somehow all of the source file except for 5 minutes was gone after it was done.
all source files? or all working files were deleted?
Like, the original .avi was just basically gone.. Dunno why.
it has an option to delete the working files... hrm, I will copy-paste the file somewhere now... but... this is taking HOURS... perhaps I selected an option? I am just making 1 avi, to a DVD, split into chapters on 10 minute intervals...
the ultimate proof that aptitude is not better than apt-get is: aptitude moo

have you checked your volume control? if pcm is turned down, it can be a problem

Ever since install i have had no sound what so ever, i tried downloading and following the realtek driver install guide in the package i downloaded from the realtek site, however that remove all other sound drivers, and i still get no sound..  everythign else works wireless, gfx card bluetooth just no sound. I have been reading up and aparently i shoudl be using oss insted of alsa however the realtek install package removed all the OSS drivers, and i cant figure out how to re install them

anyone know when Ubuntu will get rid of hal and upgrade to xorg 1.8?
prolly by meerkat, but then many apps still rely on hal
I see, tnx
1.8 will prolly be meerkat for sure- im on 1.8 in Arch right now (testing branch). But hal is a different story. Ubuntu will work without hal, but a lot of apps wont. XFCE for example needs hal.  ^
been using 1.8 on arch for some time as well. doesn't seem like 1.7 wants to support multitouch on my touchpad *cry*

i moved to a new computer with the same OS (kubuntu 14.04). I took my home directory with me, yet some fonts are not the same. I'm trying to find the font i had before. all i can remember is that the font i used in Kate (and probably elswhere too) had a musical note signs at the end of lines when i pasted CRLF-laden text from some windows VM. so, any idea how i can find a font which has a musical note sign as the CR character? :)
are you sure that it was an actual font, and not just an option in Kate?
the font i'm using now has boxes
Hey guys, have an ATI card with latest proprietary driver installed but when I full screen any youtube video I can't restore it back or get back to my desktop. any ideas?
does that do it with generic drivers?. what are the tab commands for this please?
nope
sacabonis: it is your driver then - change the driver. unfotunately i cannot suggest a better driver - I dont know ATI cards that well. I wonder if there is a way to change your Graphics Server
I was thinking is it an obvious problem with the new ATI driver or are we guessing here?

tar xf afpfs....  z says 'gzip', but you've got a bz2 file there -- that'd be j. But tar autodetects compression type these days and you can leave it off entirely. :)
thx.. seeing this at the next step...http://paste.ubuntu.com/5612399/
hahaha, that looks like an em-dash rather than two hyphens.  are you copy-psating from a wordpress blaahg? iirc those _destroy_ punctuation marks like - and ' and " and so forth..  anyway, that'd be ./configure --prefix=/usr
ok silly me. thx!
Does anyone know of a way to access extra content on a music CD? When I insert a CD, I can only access the songs, and only from cdda://scd0/; I can't really access a folder with all of the files on the disc, as I can do in Windows, surprisingly.
Does the additional content require Windows?
No, it's just .mov files (which of course play fine, with the correct packages installed from Synaptic).

Hi. i have os installed in virutalbox... can you tell how to ping from linux to guest os?
Depends on how you have setup the network.. if the network IS running.. just use the regular ping command with the guest IP as a target?
my primary host is having 192.168.1.2 guest os is having 192.168.1.22. why i am not able to reach my guest os ?. what needs to be added in virtual servr gateway
Are you SURE the guest has a working network connection? Can the guest ping the host?
ip's are assigned but not able to ping from host to guest or guest to host
I have fuse-utils installed. Any idea why `modprobe -l fuse` returns nothing?
it's fix in kernel, no module
Oh, ok, thanks. Sounds like the issue is in vmware then... :-(

Thanks, fuse is enabled I think, says "CONFIG_FUSE_FS=y"
How should I go about reformating this external hard drive so it has ext3 instead of NTFS?. What utilites are available to wipe NTFS partitions on USB drives?
mkfs.ext3 /dev/location
can I say /dev/sdc to do the whole drive as one partition instead of /dev/sdc1?.  I currently have a /dev/sdc1 and /dev/sdc2 both of which are NTFS, and both of which I'd like erased.
hello. can someone tell me how to create multiple files (I have part of the names in a text) ?
we need a bit more information
I mean I want something like aaa_%string1 from file %.rtf, aaa_%string2 from file%.rtf. Every string has it's own line.  I need to create 4 files for each string
so you need to read a file and create 4 new files comprised of some fixed characters merged with the contents of each line?
yes
I'd suggest you use either a bash script or perl.
a_%string1%.rtf b_%string1%.rtf c_%string1%.rtf d_%string1%.rtf etc.
How many lines in the file?
27 ( 27 strings).  27 * . That'll be like 104 files
It would be faster to do it manually. Writing a script of any kind would take longer if you're not a programmer.
isn't there like a bash command?
Not a single command, no.
I see..
that's a task for a script/program
thanks anyway
I tried to add a secondary gnome-panel to my desktop but it overlapped a previous one and now it just crashes. Can't click anything while in X. How do I reset my gnome-panels?

hi, does anyone know how i can fully remove xchat like i never had it so i can resinstall it? i need to remove it where it removes all my settings
sudo apt-get purge xchat
i did that already it didn't fully remove the settings
It won't remove the settings in your home folder..  Those are in ~/.xchat2. Deleting that folder should do it.
so i should after removing xchat should delete the main folder?
Yes, after you uninstall xchat, delete the .xchat2 folder in your home folder.
ok thanks
Hello. I'm having issues with Wine, it won't play sound at all, in the Audio section of the wine config there is nothing listed as a driver, while I know it needs to say winealsa.drv. yes. wair. wait, not a server, just 12.04. sorry I'. I'm a newb
I'd ask in #winehq too
I have  been a little help but no resolution yet. how do I test if it's stable?
did you check the appdb for compatibility?
It is supported
did you try wine from the wine ppa?
i have wine 1.5.9
"run 'winecfg' go to the audio tab, unclick everything except alsa. on the bottom set sample rate to 48000 , hardware accel to full, and driver emulation is not clicked. now your results may vary but this did it for me and i once again get full sound in all steam programs." source: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=550785
there's nothing to unclick, there's no selected driver and nothing in the drop down menu's in Audio

Is there a special way to uninstall stuff on Linux, or do I just go around deleting all the files?
depends on what you are removing
an application that I downloaded and installed
how did you install it
./configure ... make ... make install
go to that directory and use make uninstall
oh. I didn't know you could do that. Thanks
no problem, _most_ programs include uninstall targets :).  two things though: 1, if you delete the makefile (or the directory holding it, obviously), you lost that capability; and 2) try using ./configure, make, checkinstall
what does checkinstall do?

Hey. Its not letting me delete the partion shirtless. even from the live CD. I still get the message unable to delete dev/sda5 - POlease unmount any logical partitions having a number higher than 5. and this is when i am using the livecd shirtless. Can anyone here help me?. Basically I am in the middle of deleting a partition, but Gparted is giving me a error message
what msg?
please unmount any logical partitions havuing a number higher than 5. I am using the liveCD to do this so dont understand it 
sounds pretty straight forward then
What do i do ?
unmount any logical partition having a number higher than 5 o.o
I dont think there is any mounted and dont know what that meens
alrighty, well in your gparted screen what does it say for the various partitions?
hmm ?
when you have gparted open, it lists your various partitions, what are they?
well the list of my partitions really , /dev/sda8, 5 , 6, 7. but none of them are mounted
youve right clicked them and clicked unmount?
yeah. None of them are able to
unable to? no option or just wont let you?
in 80% of them it wont let me, in about 3 of them theres no option
exit out, run in the terminal sudo gparted
ok . it opens gparted again. and nothing T.T.  Any suggestions?
nothing?
same error message as before when i try to delete 
yeah but the unmounting part
yeah:?
does it let you now?
nope 
what err msg is it throwing when you try to unmount the ones that have the option, but wont let you?
I cant click the button. it wont let me. and when i check it it tels me its unmounted
Trying to make a Ubuntu Boot Drive from a USB stick: Tried using usb-creator, but I got an error that it could not find a partition number. Opened it up in GParted to find out that the USB drive i have is currently all unallocated space with no filesystem. When I try to add one (primary partition, Fat32, the whole disk), GParted fails. Any ideas?
UNetBootin is a good utility for making USB drives
At the moment I can't even create a filesystem on the USB drive :(
so it doesn't recognize the usb at all?
It's recognized, but when I try to put a new filesystem on it, it just fails
does it have a device location for it, like /dev/usbsomething
yeah
if you try to copy a file to it using cp, will it work?.  or even just making a file on it. see it that works from the command line
yeah i guess it does.  which is wierd
dunno...maybe it still has some formatting on it...it is possible to hide the iso image on the usb, so try zeroing out everything on the usb disk
using what? Gparted isn't working?
i'm currently running 15.04 and i'm not able to update..If i use 'Software update', I get a message saying 'Failed to download repo info','check your internet connection'...My internet is working fine
are you using any proxies or stuff like this
nope
please open a terminal and run a "sudo apt update" and show the output in a pastebin please

see the last lines of that paste. you are using PPAs that are 1) for 14.10 and 2) are off anyway.

is it possible to automatically confirm ufw enable? something like the -y option?
ufw status doesn't do it?

yes sudo.  mine says Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)?
hello, I just reinstalled my laptop with windows 10 and then ubuntu 16.04 LTS, the boot menu doesn't show up to select ubuntu. I got a sony S13A laptop from 2013, I could boot on the usb stick for install with F11 but I tried all keys and none shows a boot menu, can't find it... any suggestions ?
try looking into your bios if you have a menu where you can select an efi file to be booted (e.g. grubx64.efi)
that's the thing, I can't manage to get in :(. I tried F1, F2, F5, F10, F... delete, all keys. it goes straight to windows
esc, f8 ?
I think I did all but I'll try that one again ^^
i've got a small question: how long should the livecd take before it launches ubuntu? took me 30 minutes, then I gave up.. :(
what kind of hardware are you working with
laptop, dvd drive is kind of slow

hello, can anyone help with a routing question?. cool! Well, I set up ubuntu with 2 nics, 1 for external internet, and the other for internal. I configured DHCP and DNS on internal NIC and had iptable forwarding ports. then after a crash, when ubuntu came back, I lost ability to port forward, the ports are all still defined. And what seems strange, is that retained the Internet for all the client computers connecting to the local nic?!?. So, I'm not sure where to look next..... the internet works so that means the packets are flowing and routing
how are u doing your portfwd 
No, nics did not get renamed. BUT I also swapped the network cable to a third NIC this computer has temporarily..... that may have screw up routing?!?!. Port forwards are done with iptables and NAT
well when you did your iptables you must have put in a nic name or mac name. addr*. so if you changed that u gotta mod iptables. ifconfig; iptables -L and see if the interfaces match for your rules
the network cable swap was by accident, I was moving the computer. I put the cables back the way they were.
still worth comparing?

'man update-manager': "update-manager OPTION -d, --devel-release: Check if upgrading to the latest devel release is possible." When will update-manager -d issue automatically a notification that new software updates are available?
Which version of Ubuntu are you currently on?
Ubuntu 10.04 Beta 2.
You have no use for -d then.  since you're aleady on the development release
Can you elaborate your sentence: "You have no use for -d then" please.
You're already on the development version, so -d does nothing. There is no 'development version' for you to upgrade to.
May I thus reword my question then: When will Update Manager send an automatic notification on my desktop that new updates are available?
What updates are you talking about?.  This has actually become a 10.04 specific question, since I understand it might've changed. You should ask in #ubuntu+1
For example the package aptdaemon. The package version of aptdaemon that I am using at present is not the newest available from the repositories.

hey everyone, I've got a problem concerning my mobile phone data cable.... My computer doesn't recognise anything when I stick it in, I think it needs a program or something, but I don't really understand.
Maybe it doesn't go for *that* sort of thing man.  No but really, what hardware?
Well I've got a samsung E720 and an accompanying data cable (direct phone to USB). When I still ran windows, I could get a steering program for that from the samsung website, but there's no such thing for linux.
There may be. What sort of things do you want to do? Copy files over, or syncronise stuff?

hi. I've updated something on my ubuntu 14.04 and now my speakers don't turn off when I plug in headphones. How to fix that?:)
check in sound options if jacksense is checked. !info protege
I can't find this option in sound options(
or you can try alsamixer in a terminal and start ticking the checkboxes. or unmuting
I tried gnome-alsamixer. When I check auto-mute nothing happens and in console there is "** (gnome-alsamixer:4792): WARNING **: gam_toggle_set_state (). No idea what to do for mixer element "Auto-Mute Mode"!"
try unmuting some of the spdif channels.  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ALSA/JackSense
I have sound from both headphones and speakers now, how unmuting something else can help?. seeems upgrade brought some broken modules and this feature is broken on my setup now. I just can't figure what package does this
it's probably just a setting umuting one of the spdif's or whatever usually re-enables jacksense
well I tried all ticks there and nothing changes anything(
you can try #also or the forums or askubuntu
Can you tell me what package could be upgraded and lead to this? Something with alsa?
most likely
only gstreamer1.0-alsa was updated(
that shouldn't do it any other "sound" packages ?
http://pastebin.com/a4F2K2WM it will be very difficult to find :)

within .screenrc i put screen -t windowname 2 cd /home/folder/folder/. when i execute screen it opens up all my other screen windows, but for the one with cd it says cannot exec cd: no such file or directory
I'd venture a guess that 'cd' is a shell command, and you're not running a shell.
doesn't screen execute linux commands upon connect if you've configured them in .screenrc?. because i have screen -t top 0 top and when screen starts it starts top in that window

https://ghostbin.com/paste/hb9wq
can you dump me contents of /var/log/Xorg.0.log?. in the same paste
done please check the link again
you are using some PPA with newest Xorg and support for amdgpu-pro, I assume? Well, AFAIK amdgpu-pro is not supported on anything lower than RadeonSI (7xxx). But the possible reason of why no driver at all is loaded could be different - like you didn't update initramfs or didn't install newer kernel required for the library..  looking up.  yeah, you are trying amdgpu-pro with old kernel 4.4
so what should I do now?
this line "[ 29.562] (II) [KMS] drm report modesetting isn't supported.".  two things - you can either remove the PPA and get back to original state, or you can install kernel - but you need said hardware support for amdgpu-pro. AFAIK its currently even only available for rx 4xx, with planned expansion towards 7xxx..  so if you go path 2, then you will end up with newer "radeon" driver.
Would you please help me out what ever you think is better for me
I have stock HWE 4.8 kernel here (16.04 LTS) and xenial backports activated. Works for my r9.
because I really don't what to do now. https://ghostbin.com/paste/984xp
short version - we can either unroll the changes(1) or finish the changes(2), however that amdgpu-pro driver supports only hardware rx 4xx. It will not support 5xxx, you will be using NEWER stack.. you will be using NEWER "radeon" driver on your hardware, not "amdgpu-pro".
SO it's up to you final decision
I would roll back the changes, unless you want to experiment..  can you please give me output of this: "grep ^ /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*"
we can remove the amdgpu-pro and installing the suitable driver?
basically this.  even if you install required Kernel for amdgpu, the amdgpupro will NOT run on your hardware..  "radeon" driver will, its newer version.

how would I find the partition label for my Windows partition (hd0,1),(hd0,2), etc. etc. So I can edit GRUB
run gnome partition editor and see what the windows partition is called?

in the lower part of the gpart window the partitions are listed.. the first column should be the device name
wait. Would /dev/sda1 be (hd0,1). or /dev/sda2 (hd0,2)
nope.. sda1 is hd0,0
ooooh. ok

Hey all; I am getting an error, and I have no idea why: 'Refusing to read archive contents from terminal (missing -f option?)' -- I did give -f in two places. this the command used: tar cpf - ~/ | ssh -24to StrictHostKeyChecking=no -tY24 sxonly@192.168.1.65 "tar xpf - -C ~/homeOfSysAdmin"
why are you telling tar to archive '-' ?
@ Im just trying to archive across my servers -- local/main system is out of space
sure, but your command makes no sense.  tar -cpf is 'create', 'preserve' and write to this file
@ very likely -- it was a command I used years ago on debian and I cannot remember the correct syntax; I willhave to play with it some more

USB-CREATOR-KDE doesnt work properlly, its impossible to add an .iso to burn, in cli appears: QInotifyFileSystemWatcherEngine::addPaths: inotify_add_watch failed: No such file or directory
sounds like a bug.
can you try reproduce?
i'm not on KDE, so no. Nor am I on an Ubuntu system at this moment. that does look like a bug, or something's broken, though. i'm not one to debug that though..  remember, not everyone here runs every package (if you're using the KDE version, as a Kubuntu user to confirm). (or file a bug)
usb-creator-kde onnly requires this -> Depends: python2.7, python (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2), python (<< 2.8), usb-creator-common (= 0.2.40ubuntu1), python-kde4, python-qt4-dbus.  i dont see there any kde specific package

Hello All. i deleted a file by mistake with shift+del, is it possible to recover deleted file???
not without a lot of grief using foremost, do you have a backup?
backup??
yes, a copy of your files incase your hard drive fails.  on an external storae like an external drive, or cd
no
why not?
i deleted that file by mistake, so now m struggling to recover it if possible
if you boot to a live cd you can run foremost on the partition to extract all files of a certain type to a different partition.  its not garunteed to work but may be good. if the file name is very common you will be recovering a lot of extra data as well as the file you removed.  if you had a backup you would not be in this mess as the data would simply be restorable from the backup
it was just a Video file of 1.1 GB

I think that is the path, not completely sure
i'll check
you should be able to do --with-wx-config=

So what do I do if my ubuntu upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10 is taking days to install and configure the packages it took a couple hours to download?
using some kind of ancient esoteirc hardware or recent stuff?
it's an older vaio, but the previous upgrades I've done have only taken a few hours.
older is relative, what year is it from? Normally an upgrade shouldnt run for more then a few hours. a few days would mean it hangs or is stuck.  may be the bottom of the update-manager you can click something to show the installation console to see what its currently doing/attempting
It's still moving.. Acicula, I've had the console open
br10ta10: what type of card do you have?
good question. iwconfig mentions HERMES, but not sure that is right.
br10ta10: it should show up in ifconfig
it doesn't. eth1 is listed in iwconfig, but not ifconfig.
br10ta10: is it pcmcia or an internal card?
internal
br10ta10: lspci should give you the type
lspci doesn't list it at all. the only "net" entry is Intel Corporation 82551QM Ethernet Controller
if it is internal then I would expect it to be mini-pci and for lspci to show it
http://pastebin.com/d21cceae4 I don't think I'm missing it, am I?
no it looks like it is just an ethernet card
hmm. it should be there. WindowsXP can see it. Do I need to install a driver before I can even see it in lspci??
no, the driver should load automatically - I was just going to suggest looking for it.  I just found this on the forums - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=304217#4.  you could see if an orinoco driver is loaded - lsmod | grep orinoco.  and try lsmod | grep hermes
I just looked in a certain rpm based distros repos and you can install synaptic for rpm package management. I guess thats like a mirror opposite of installing Yum in ubuntu which is deb based. I see that some functionality is lost however, no synaptic "generate download script" functionality. hmm
dunno what would be exact option in ubuntu but I'm sure you'll find it.  yeah they operate different, yum looks quite similar to apt-get but the way they display various stuff is different.. imo I find yum is very slow compared to apt-get

does ubuntu keep shutdown logs I can inspect?. I need to know why it just suddenly shutdown
how I do retrieve those logs?
ok, now the reason I really came here, 10.10 is the last version that will run on a ppc correct?
it seems that way, technically ppc hasn't been supported officially since 6.10
thanks. Got a friend who wants to dip a toe in and give it a try.. but the only spare he has lying around is an old g4
Anyone have any idea how to disable the popup for display arrangement when 17.10 detects a new display attached?. It keeps killing my triple monitor setup by putting it to mirror or laptop display only or external only whenever it comes out of sleep mode. Also does anyone have any idea how to prevent gpu-manager from killing my xorg.conf on EVERY reboot
you can set the config file immutable so it doesn't change
if i do that it won't boot.  it crashes on starting session / starting nvidia something ... i can't remember exactly i'd have to set it reboot, and then reboot into recovery to fix
what is gpu-manager used for? can you disable it?
i've commented out the /etc/init/ file .. honestly i don't know what else is caling it..  ^
try disabling gpu-manager and see if it's needed
That's the problem, i can't disable it because i can't find what's calling it
if it's systemd in 17.10, then systemctl disable service
this is what happens when I disabled gpu-manager or set xorg.conf immutable https://www.amazon.com/photos/share/UG88tWEddanSEBmMnsQdMpJ3SMFspphTtKEogxIjZW1
need so help......where is the video config file kept.....need to change resolution manually. yup 9.04

last night i got easyubuntu, with the help of some members of this chat, and this morning, when i open synaptic, i get this error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9979
gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list, look for the line that has cdrom in it, and put a # at the beginning; then use synaptic to reload sources
NickGarvey, it is blank
that for me?
yes, osrry.  but it is: home/michael/'/etc/apt/sources
no, your sources are in not in home at any way; /etc/apt/sources.list
i typed what you gave me and that's what it opened
gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list <--- cut and paste into a terminal
i have been.  i get this in terminal: (gedit:23799): GnomeUI-WARNING **: While connecting to session manager:. Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed.

Do LTS versions (i.e. 14.04 LTS) get kernel updates? I am referencing https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1326725/comments/52 and my PS3 USB controller support would be fixed, but if it won't I guess I need to do this manually.
you get choice.  you can use different Ubuntu branch kernels with it
As part of standard install? well will that kernel get upgraded if I just wait?. rather than force users of my project to upgrade the kernel
as part of standard install it stays with oldest Canonical can maintain.  you can switch to using latest Ubuntu kernel with LTS any time though. for example I'm rocking 3.11 on 12.04LTS. :D. (I could be on 3.13 but it's broken for some things)
ah ok,  , so to do that, should I just install the deb like this: http://www.sysads.co.uk/2014/04/installupgrade-linux-kernel-3-14-trusty-ubuntu/
and a 1G swap is pretty small , should be at least as large as one's RAM on a laptop
no, only if you use hibernation.. nearly noone uses hibernation
lot's of ppl do

Help, I am having trouble making a backup of my system to my external hard drive, I did rsync -avh --delete --stats /home/sebastian/ /media/SAMSUNG/mybackup and i got a whole bunch of outputs with these errors rsync: chgrp "/media/SAMSUNG/mybackup/.icons/Mac4Lin_Icons_v0.4/scalable/mimetypes/application-x-rar.png" failed: Operation not permitted (1). far as i know the hard drive is mounted
probably you do not have the permissions to writte in the backupdisk
how do i get hte permissions? i used sudo. it worked the first couple of times i backed up
what filesystem is used on the backup disk ?
how do i check that?.  msdos
grep -i samsung /proc/mounts.  well you can not store unix permissions/ownership on a vfat filesystem
/dev/sdd1 /media/SAMSUNG vfat rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,uid=1000,fmask=0077,dmask=0077,codepage=cp437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,utf8 0 0
you have to use tar to do the backup
tar ?. please elaborate
and vfat has a 4GiB limit on filesize so
tar?
tar cvzpf /media/SAMSUNG/mybackup.tgz /home/sebastian/.  vfat has a 4GiB limit on filesize so maybe not even that would work (if the backupfie is too large)
if i copy and paste that into the terminal it will do a backup of everything on the laptop?
a tar file is like a zip file. but it can store unix permission and ownership
does cvzpf stand for anything ?
no it will backup everythin in /home/sebastian to a file in /media/SAMSUNG/
but it had already worked before...and it copied up to 30 gb
c -> create v -> vervose z -> compressed p -> with permissions f -> filename fllows.  maybe you used other options for rsync
how so? i used the same folders
#test
/join #channelname
oh thanks :). join #test
this is going to piss me off
gedit /etc/lsb-release

on that fstab the drives are listed as hda, and on the mntblock cmd they are sda, should i change them to sda ?
they're not listed as hda. look carefully, all the lines mentioning "hda" start with #, i.e. are comments
ahh yes
that's one of the core reasons behind the use of UUIDs - make the transition from hda to sda invisible
probobly for sata huh. i see
you can change them if you want of course, for clarity, but the system doesn't care
LJL here goes the reboot
how do i configure and/or diagnose my eth1 port, connected to my xbox 360?

hi!. looking for unrar package, I discover the "multiverse" component... In the web (http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/components/document_view) there isn't information about this component. what does it includes?
you can download the .deb from a Debian repo
yes, but I don't have any problem at installing the unrar.deb package... what I'm asking is what is multiverse component. is it a repository like Debian non-free?
Yes, I DID install it but it says it is not in use. I am going to go to the program where I encountered the error that caused me to come in here asking questions ;). Ok I will type in what it says.

I'm on 64bit ubuntu, Intrepid. I'm trying to install libc6-dev-i386, but I get: "libc6-dev-i386: Depends: libc6-i386 (= 2.8~20080505-0ubuntu7) but 2.8~20080505-0ubuntu9 is to be installed"... Is there a nice way to resolve this? (I'm trying to install a 32bit mplayer so I can get win32 codecs).
you will need to install libc6-i386
- It's already installed, but it's a different version...
what version do you have installed?.  dpkg -l | grep libc6-i386
- 2.8~20080505-0ubuntu9. It wants 2.8~20080505-0ubuntu7
you could force install it, i'd check they are backward compatible
- They probably are, it's ubuntu build versions that differ...

is anybody familiar with marvell yukon Ethernet card problems?
I had lots of issues with the yukon chipset in my desktop machine. I put in a different network card..  dmesg had all kinds of warnings, and problems reported about that thing.
damn. :(. i don't get any error or warnings
!lstp
it just hangs up every once in awhile. i guess i'll just have to buy another card
yep. thats what it does... others have issues with the cards working at all. I would get ok connection for a while then about every 10 min. it would hang for a min+ then reset. and work for a while more
what card did you get?
really hurt my torrent and ircing.,.  i just grabbed a GB network card from the box-o-parts i had in the basement. :)
yea i know. haha. i just tried 3 old Intel ones. none of them worked. :(
If i had realized that yukon wasent a gb nic to begin with.. i would of replaced it ages ago..  thats odd.. intel shouldbe very well supported
they are like 5-6 years old

strange, tried restart ? or atleast issuing a sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart. ?
restarting the computer will probably work, I just don't want to. alsa-utils restart doesn't work

Hi!. is anyone here able to help me with a mdadm problem?
what's the issue ?
I'm trying to set up a mail report wich will give me an report of the RAID setup, even if there is no faults or errors. But I get this error when trying to run the command "mdadm --monitor --scan --test": "Only one autorebuild proccess allowed in scan mode, aborting". and I would like mdadm to send me a mail once a week or so... Varikonniemi: I thought this would be a place to start :)
ok so there is normally already an automatic report on this if you set the mail address in the mdadm.conf.  the monitor command must also speficy a meta device
Ikonia: yes, there is, but only if there is an error or failure to one of the disks. And i don't know if the mail will be sent at all... Ikonia: like this? mdadm --monitor --test /mnt/md0
apologies, I'm missing the issue here, why do you want a mail report if there is nothing failed.  I'm assuming you want to background it, rather than run it from an active shell
Ikonia: Because then i know the system is working, the mails get sent and that I will get a mail if there is something wrong :). Ikonia: that's right :)
so for example mdadm --monitor --daemonise --mail=root@localhost --delay=1800 /dev/md2".  madam --monitor is meant to be triggered on failure.  you're probably better monitoring /proc/mdstat with a shell script if you want regular "everything is ok" reports
Ikonia: Ah, that explaines the --monitor option. thank you!. is the daemonise syntax an complete syntax? would it work like you wrote it?
should do yes
Ikonia: I'll try :)
please pay attention to the mail address in the example too
Ikonia: is the --delay option in seconds?

any chance someone can answer this for me (learning stuff as I go and I'm stuck on this one); I registered a domain name, I added it as the reverse DNS thingy to my VPS' IP address. when I traceroute my VPS' IP-address it resolves to mydomainname.com but when I go to my domainname I'm not getting anywhere. Anyone that can point me in the right direction to look for the error?. (running ubuntu server btw...home this is the right channel :x)
when you ping the domain does it resolve correctly?
can't resolve hostname
what host are you using for your domain?
call me dumb but... you mean the hosting party where I rent my Virtual server?
maybe I read the question wrong.. setting up a registerd domain to a local computer?
no it's all 'on the www' so to speak. I have a VPS with 1 IP address, and a registered .com domainname. I set the domainname as the DNS-reverse thingy to that IP address. When I traceroute www.domain.com it says "unknown host" when I traceroute the VPS IP-address it hops around and resolves to www.domain.com. makes sense?
I think you may need to set your A record
thx  one last thing... do I set that somewhere in Ubuntu or somewhere else?
the A record is the name to ip entry that is set at the registar of the domain.. would not be set locally on the pc.. it is what resolves the domain to the ip
thank you, forgive my ignorance please :)
no problem.. gota start somewhere
yea but I always start at the deepest end of the pool, haha
yeah I do the same thing haha
woohoo it works (apparently i already fixed it but that A-record thing wasnt done by my host or something)

tap shift every so often
what yo mean alex?.  what yo mean?
do you see a Shift key next to Z? theres another on the opasite side of that row
yes i know, but does hitting shift fix my monitor problem?. was kinda wondering how shift, could fix that.
it's sleeping during installation cause DKMS (i think) is set to 5-10 minutes depending on graphics card ;)
aah ty . ill go hit shift then.. thx for the help.
Hi, I am trying to install ubuntu, but it says it cannot install ext3 to root when using manual installation and cryted setup... always failing. is this not compatible?
i have ext3 on luks, but i didn't do it through the installer, so can't confirm
it keeps failing on and on, ext4 too... dont know why.... so it might be installer related
can you see errors in ctrl+alt+f2 or ctrl+alt+f3 ?. i forgot which virtual console outputs installer stuff
nothing there, no
so what is the actual error you get?
I should go back to partitioning because \ mounting point could not be bound to ext3 file system (free translation from my language) after pressing back, everything in the crypt mapper is messed up and nothing works and I'm left with rebooting or even a hard reset. I got a 200mb efi partition, one ext where i put boot and 2 which I want to crypt to put root and home...
sorry i don't know
ok, thank you so far :-)

hi i want to be able to connect to a machine via ssh with publickey, what file do i have to edit again to allow this and not only per passwort entry?
you have to add the public key from the client machine to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server. Usually, I just do "ssh-copy-id", and I'm done...
there is a option somewhere to enable publickey authentification and disable the password one. cause i can login with password but the key is not accepted even thou copied the right way
Yes, that'd be in /etc/ssh/sshd_config...
ahh thanks!

Could not start the X Server (your graphical envioroment) due to some internal error. Please contact your system administrator or check your syslog to diagnose. In the meantime this display will be disabled. Please re-start GDM when the problem is corrected.. then after about 30 seconds a prompt based login system shows up. if I try to log in it doesnt work, after I enter my username and password it just goes back to asking me for a login. any ideas anyone?
What's the last thing you did, added, or changed on your system before it started doing that? Have you checked the logfiles for clues?

I want to uninstall ubuntu-desktop... it won't go away :(
thats a meta-package. why do yuou want to remove it?
don't like it :)
removeing it does nothinh
I installed it... I should be able to remove it
apt-get remove pacjagename
I did purge
it wont acomplish anything
I know. so.... how do I replace it?
apt-get install packagename
why won't it go away? Saying it's a metapackge doesn't mean anything to me.
saying it wont 'go away' tells us nothing. apt-get remove should remove it
well.. before I installed it, I had a command line.. Now I have a background... with no command line
go to theconsole and you have a command line
And can't access any commands. I'm on the console. all I have is a background

hi, i'm using ubuntu hardy(2.6.24-19-generic), while trying to create an ubuntu package in a pbuilder chail everything seems fine, dh_make finishes clean, "pbuilder create *.dsc" does fine, but "sudo pbuilder build *.dsc" finishes with "Tcl cannot be found on this system.", seems like "pbuilder create" doesn't care about the tcl-dependency. any idea about what i can do to get this build done would be really apreciated

hi ... i am getting this error: mplayer: error while loading shared libraries: libartsc.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. when trying to play files with SMPlayer. any clues?
install arts
how?
which version of ubuntu do you have?
9.04.  i tried searching for the package.. but didnt find any named arts
sounds like a bug. !bug
not finding the package?
yeah, arts is the old kde 3.5 sound server, it's not in jaunty.  and you did install smplayer from jaunty repo?
no .. i had it preinstalled .. and then i upgraded from 8.10 .. and multimedia is all f*&#$d up
oh, then it's not a bug.  you need to reinstall smplayer and its dependencies
so first i remove it?. i did try and install all the codecs and all from a howto for 9.04 .. but that didnt help
but it should have been upgraded automatically... how exactly did you upgrade?
i upgraded through the option it gives when you are updating ..
ok.. what version of smplayer is installed? 'dpkg -l |grep smplayer'
how do i remove and install all its dependencies again?.  0.6.6.  apt-get remove smplayer .. and apt-get install smplayer are only installing smplayer .. not any of the libraries ...
hi folks: how do I find out what files were used/are being used in a running gui-based application? (gnome windows manager, edgy)
like lsof | grep gnome or something?

there are probably people here who could give a better answer but thats what i use
can you describe your method a little more? do you mind?
I have a thumb drive. It seems to only work in ONE of my usb ports, and even with that port it doesn't work 100% of the time.,. but if i take it out and put it back in a few times it'll finally work. What the heck!
hey, I've been having that too a bit. But sorry, don't know why.. also, that only happens on my desktop box, not the laptop (maybe because the laptop doesn't have usb2)
. Ar first I thought it might be a contact problem, but this laptop is dual boot and it works 100% in windows. Hmm. my laptop DOES have usb2. so maybe thats where the problem is

hi all, I was wondering how I could get the latest tmux for Ubuntu. There only seems to be 1 PPA which has tmux, but I don't know if I can deem it as trustworthy - https://launchpad.net/~pi-rho/+archive/ubuntu/dev?field.series_filter=precise - would you deem this as trustworthy?
utopic has it.
right, but I'm on 12.04
It still may work if it doesn't require too many dependencies. Otherwise you can compile it from source and turn it into a deb package using checkinstall instead of make install.
you mean enable 14.10's PPA on here?. also when compiling, am I going to receive updates when I do apt-get update && apt-get updgrade ?. *after compiling
can anyone help?
try going to a console with ALT-F1, then "ps -ef | grep gnome"... maybe there's a dead gnome-panel process or something that you need to kill
nothing
then look at the logs /var/log/gdm
nothing other than missing fonts. which have been there the whole time
when you checked for gnome processes, you didnt kill gdm, did you? (you shouldn't)
ok, i tried with gdm running, and all that is there is gnome-keyring-daemon
now try "sudo killall gnome-keyring-daemon" without stopping gdm
its gone, but still nothing is happening
hi all... what is the command to remove execute privileges from a file? i mean opposite of chmod 755 ..? is that correct?
well, no. That would leave the execute permissions for the owner of the file
i meant opposite of chmod 755... i want to remove the execute privilege for a simple text file i created in an ntfs partition, but whenever i create a file in the ntfs partition it contains the execute privilages!
default umask for users is 0022, creating files in 644 mode (-rw-r--r--)
so doing chmod 644 for the file would remove the execute?
ah yes, for NTFS partitions it' an other story.
ok so how do i proceed?
you have to specify the permissions for NTFS partitions during mount time (e.g. in /etc/fstab) For more info, see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
automatic mount? i edited the fstab since i didnt want auto mount...! why is that essential for preventing the file from gaining execute privileges?

I'll start you off.

Nah, right here. I think technically we're suppose to give support in channel.
ok :)
Though I have nothign really against PM..  Have you downloaded the latest source you wanted?
it's just easier since the channel is easy.  yea i downloaded it
kcool.  If you've never built something from source, you'll need to "sudo apt-get install build-essentials"
yea i got that :)
Generally it's as simple as running "./configure" then "make" then "sudo make install"
ah cool ty :)
Depending on the output of "./configure" - often you'll need to install a few "SOMETHING-dev" packages
nope lol, gone straight through. ty :D.  and it fixed the bug i had in the amsn in the repos, yay \o/
Will removing ssh alter performance on my box?

heh, ok. I don't use ssh so I'm removing i
I altered the port i run it on....  oh... then that will save you like whole 100kb of space hehehe
Bah! I'm paranoid so I removed it. lol.  I'm also a space-freak. I need every available kb of free space. I'm rather obsessive about it =)

I'm having some trouble installing Ubuntu on my keyboard, I've plugged the USB on but it doesn't boot?. I used win32 to copy the image onto my 256mb USB. Does it matter if it's a non-branded USB stick or Corsair?. Also it's a razer keyboard
use unetbootin to create your boot usb.  you can't just copy the image in most cases
I've tried that also, but when I plug it into my keyboard it doesn't boot
plug directly into the computer. the usb hub in the keyboard may not be initialized in time to be recognized by the bios
Does it matter which USB slot I plug it into, I have 12. I have one built into my mobo near to the CPU will that effect speed?
It should be in a USB port directly connected to the mainboard. no hubs
Should I try and boot from a Floppy? I have one of those. I don't think the image will fit onto that though

Hi, i seem to be having a problem with Java. I have both Java Runtime and the Browser Plugin installed, but whenever i come across a site with Java in it Firefox says i dont have Java installed. Anyone know how to fix this?
<unconvertable> : Let's start by taking a look at things from Firefox's point of view.
ok, what do i do?
<unconvertable>  First, type about:config into firefox.
alright
<unconvertable>  In the filter, type plugin_expose_full_path or something like that.. <unconvertable>  When you find it, double click it to make it true.
i searched "plugin_expose_full_path" and got nothing
<unconvertable>  k, then just search for fullpath
its set to false
<unconvertable>  double click it to set to true
alright
<unconvertable>  Now, we'll be able to see where the Java Plugin is coming from.
alright
<unconvertable>  Now go to about:plugins.
alright
<unconvertable>  Do you see Java listed?
no, i do not
alright. <unconvertable>  Did you install the Java plugin via Synaptic?
Adept
ok will do a fsck -yfv. stop me if that's wrong :)
ok boot to sabayon and check du output first

Hello. I'm looking for instructions about creating a custom language setting for Aurebesh & Sith languages.
sith as in the star wars one?
yes.
that would be more a irc client thing, unless you meant system wide on ubuntu
I want language settings so that when I enter text, others can see my language font.. If I could use a separate language setting with my font, then I could make that a community thing. That would be alright, though I'm not sure how to easily do that.. So, if I could use Farose language setting with Aurebesh font, that would be alright.

anyone for my wireless issue?
I can help with broadcomm
thanks, ya its a broadcom. keeps trying to connect and wont. says network disconnected every 3 mins or so
did you install the broadcom sta driver?
ya, through restricted drivers. i mean additional drivers
and you're sure your wifi signal is clean and constant?
yes. i checked other devices.  should i try removing it and reinstalling? everything looks fine
thinking - is it acting up ONLY on that one network? test with other hotspots B4 reinstalling
tried different network, same thing, wireless icon just shows as if its trying to connect
completely update before you reinstall...or try a manual installation. download the STA drivers from broadcom's site.
did a complete update and also did manual install as google suggested, forgot to mention that
grr. ok, then, next thing I'd try would be reinstalling.
reinstalling the os? isnt that a little drastic?
NO NO NO - just the wifi drivers.
just did, checking now :p.  same issue
sorry, then, I can't be of help. stay in channel and ask again...
its like its taking forever to connect forever.  ok thanks. anyone here to help with an odd broadcom issue? ubuntu 12.04 wireless just sits and tries to connect....  could it have been that when i installed the system installed a generic wireless driver of some sort and its conflicting?

Okay, I'm trying to format a USB flash drive which needs to be usable with Windows machines. What's the difference between the "msdos" and "vfat" filesystems which I seem to be able to specify with mkfs at the terminal?
vfat = fat32 which is the filesystem used from windows98 +. ideally you should use NTFS tho..
Is there any reason why I should use NTFS? It's only a 512MB flash drive
um... its the modern windows standard.. fat32 will work fine .. its personal preference really
Ahhh okay. I was thinking Fat32 in case I need to plug it into a Mac. (NTFS-3G is still technically beta on Mac OS X)
and my laptop does not have a cd rom drive how to boot from pendrive i have a 2 GB pendrive now i want to install it there

that may be your connection acting up
this is the only method , how can i resolve this problem
that looks like a really big repo, you may need a good connection to download all the data from it.  you can download it instead from the github page maybe. http://github.com/rhomobile/rhosync should have a download link
rhomobile for windows has the download file. but for linux, just recomand use the "git clone". what can i do now?
http://github.com/rhomobile/rhosync should have a download link to "Download Source", which is essentially what you'll get from doing a `git clone`
thanks , i will go and try.  i go to the web page and find that : RhoSync-1-4-1_setup.exe RhoSync v1.4.1 Windows Installer. there do not exit for linux. 
lol.. well, 1440x1440 is on the list of Modes, but it doesnt show up on my resolution list. whats a good resolution for a 19inch Widescreen monitor>. ?*

hm my computer restarted while i was away. is there some way to find out why?. like what happened
examine '/var/log/syslog'.  look for the string 'restart.' to jump to times when you booted, and go backwards from there.

you got the file permissions right?
which files?
check that you're in the 'dialout' group, for starters. Markeda, do: grep dislout /etc/group. dialout, i mean
ah, ok. thx. Pelo: I think I've tried that, I'll give it another go

I have 4gb ram, and set vm.swappiness=10 yet I have 2.2gb ram in use (cache/buffers have pushed usage way way higher tho) and I am using 200mb swap,is this normal, even tho I set swappiness?
try vm.swappiness=0 thatll use swap only if extremely needed
Ive heard bad things about using zero. I can give it a try I guess
i used to use 0 all the time.  ts fine
looking at free -m the cache/buffer usage is whats pushing my memory to nearly full, might explain why its used, but thought buffers would be reduced before swap is used.
stuff gets cached in ram even with no swap.  so it will build up some
yeah, I just thought the system would prioritise and choose to reduce buffer usage to free ram up rather than hit swap. I'll give you method a try.
what packages do i need to have installed ?
you do. what command did you use to mount it?
mate , you cant mount something that isnt in /dev/ and hda1 or hda2 are simply not there
didn't fdisk -l just show them?
it did, which puzzles me.
maybe it's a udev thing
"ls /dev/ | grep hda" gives me only /dev/hda
sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt doesn't work?
ok , so suppose it is , what am i to do about this? paint my puter blue and toss it into the ocean? lol.  no lol
okay, you didn't say you tried to mount it, just that it's not in /dev. so, let's see...fdisk sees it, /dev dont.  that just doesn't make sense
i agree
well, at least you know you're not crazy :)
notice tho that fdisk -l shows hda1 and hda2 as SFS system

hey all. is lm-sensors accurate?
as accurate as the settings/maps are you feed into it.  in my experience, the temp sensors are ok; the fans often suck. voltage, so-so
just curious as to which is the cpu temp
it hugely depends on the quality of the sensors
some say 62 deg and some say 40. which is a big difference
which one. the highest will be core temp. the lower ones mainboard sensors
well thats my point, there about 5 different cpu0 temperatures that it makes the values near pointless

hey. Im trying to burn ISO to USB using terminal with command dd but when i try to boot pc from USB it doesnt boot it. Im trying to burn ISO to USB using terminal with command dd but when i try to boot pc from USB it doesnt boot it. ANYONE HELP?
what's the command you're using?
Im using "sudo dd if=isofile.iso of=/dev/sdb1"
you need to give dd the disk name, not the partition, like /dev/sdb
hmm. ah ok. not sdb1?
use sudo dd if=iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M && sync
aaaah.  foolish me.  what is sync command and bs=4m for?
bs=4M is the block size of the transfer and sync is so that everything is written for sure
so what bs=4M does?
transfers 4mb of blocks at a time, makes it faster
is this command correct? "sudo mkfs.vfat -n "UBUNTUMATE" -I /dev/sdb"

going into D ?
uninterruptible sleep
I'd be very concerned if your san had that much latency fsck was timing out
fsck is not timing out, but seems to be "find / |xargs rm" was the first process going into uninterruptible sleep
how many disks are making up the volume group that the logical volume is in
two

running vmware workstation really decreases my 9 cell battery by a substantial amount... would say 10-15% faster than normal... without installations or applications running in the virtual machine, my host - 8.04, running the system monitor shows 20-40% of cpu usage between the two cpus and about 4/11ths (not quite half) of the memory being used... why is the battery discharging so fast and do you have any thoughts?
it's running a virtualization environment -- in effect two operating systems, what do you expect?.  you could tune the memory settings, don't know/remember the cpu settings (though amd/intel virtualization enabled cpu advancements do make it faster).  obviously, your battery, etc. would all last longer, but you'll get degraded performance out of vmware
I expect that if the vm was installing something or running an application - then it's acceptable... but the vm wasn't even doing anything... :/

I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 with a Delta 1010LT sound card. First day I got everything set up fine, with a combination of changing some files and download Envy24 control software. All of a sudden today the sound stops working, and I have no ideas why. I see the sound meter in the Envy24 controller move up and down, at least on the software level the sound is being sent. I double checked my cabling and it's fine. What else could. be the problem ?
try: killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*
ummm, that doesn't seem like a good idea 
it will reset the sound settings, pulse will resetart in seconds and the file and folder will be regenerated. Why is it not a good idea?
in any case I tried it, it didn't work
if you also look at the ubuntu sound troubleshooting page it also lists it.  why did it not seem like a good idea.  then ask for clarification, rather than saying it doesn't seem like a bad idea

Can't ping from the machine with static IP?
correct. cant hit outside dns or ip address, only internal. whoa.... just a sec.. every once in a while it does actually get a response to ping. but it is hit and miss.. when i go back to dhcp it all works perfectly
Does the machine with the static IP have a legit DNS nameserver address in the interface definition?
i did dns in the resolve.conf. the address is legit

Upgrade to 10.04 and if the problem persists then file a bug report and it may get fixed (bugs are more likely to be fixed in 10.04 since it's the most recent release and also a long term support release).

Hey, I need to give /opt/lampp/htdocs/wordpress permissions, because wordpress is complaining about them. What's the command I should use? (not just chroot but the whole thing, if you don't mind)
what permissions do you want to give?
errr, global if possible.  What should I do
use the chmod command to change the permission os a file... if you want to make the file readable-writable-executable by the user give the command 'chmod 700 /path/of/the/file'
I know what directory, Just I have no idea what I should use
the 'chmod 700 /opt/lampp/htdocs/wordpress' command will give it global permissions... if you mean this!

drive_c?
that's your WINE installation's virtual `C' drive.
ok
And you can put things in there as you please.
should i move everything there?
typically, if you install something, it'll end up in there.
it's not an install, 
Quick unity question for you folks. Under "classic" mode, my virtual desktops are appearing in a grid (good). but all 9 seem to want to appear as a single row (despite configuration saying 3x3) when in Unity 2D mode. Am I missing something obvious?. My previous install (an upgrade of an upgrade of an upgrade... dating back to I believe 9.10? 10.04?) didn't have this issue.
Well for one thing, unity sucks
indeed. more of a curiosity than anything else.
i have 2 gigs of ram. after a few days of running my machine reports I have some 300-400 megs of ram. when i run the free command. any idea why my ram just disappears?
proably being used for caching.  its a good thing that ram is being used
it's my total ram that's being reported wrong.  i'm looking at the right number here
can someone recommend a nice tool for metadata and id3 tag editing? on multiple files etc
there's a command line library. Other than that, I'll be curious to know what you find.
you mean to edit tags? theres got to be loads of them out there?
So then what are you looking for. I guess I'm confused.
I want to edit metadata on mostly mp3's and flac's, the id3 tags and such..
the package that didn't make me tear my hair out was just called id3 (I looked)
sounds great, thanks alot
I'm having a problem with my notebook's CPU fan. After boot, it's fine, but resume from Suspend or Hibernate, and it spins like nuts, full time.. I've tried installing fancontrol and thinkfan, but they won't automatically throttle the fan speed.
is it a thinkpad? try unloading/reloading the tp-modules after resume
It's not a thinkpad, it was just something I wanted to try. It's actually a business-grade hp. Model "Compaq 2510p".  sorry, forgot to point that at you. :)
ok, I can't find many references on this. but I've got the amd catalyst driver, how do I move windows between desktops (not xinerama, it's not a spanning desktop, it's a multi-desktop)?
That would depend not on the hardware but on the window manager you're running (Gnome? Unity?)
Gnome
Are the displays the same size?
they're the same resolution
Does click-and-drag not work?
no, it does if I enable xinerama, but then I get a spanning desktop
I can't move a window if it's full screen.. ...
multi-desktop (yes I haven't heard of it before) is like two different desktops, each one has it's own panel apps and workspaces
So you want the system to treat the two desktops as different workspaces like they would be on a multi-desktop single-display?
yes, that would be great
how do i setup a .. dns i guess you could say. for my computers behind the router?
bind
is that a program?
bind is a DNS daemon for Linux. :)
does mac have it?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND.  probably
and thats for .. for each client?
- no... its a nameserver that all the other clients can do lookups on
so i need one computer to do this on?
does anyone know what in the world is opengltextures?
they are ... textures... some video drivers simply don't work well, for instance some via drivers, and that's it.
how can I make that work?
unless your driver really supports them you can't do a thing, if you are a programmer you can mess with the code, reverse engineer and create drivers yourself

how can I install a gui in that @

good question. cd32@-desktop:~$. gnome?
my audio and video files randomly stopped working. they won't play with any applications. even when i download new ones. is there some weird update i installed that messed this up?. they stopped playing
so the player aborts playing. or is there just no sound and/or video?
no.  i open the file with a player and it says the file is playing but the time marker isn't moving and theres no sound coming out of the headphones
the files are local on your disk or over network?
local disk. local SATA hard drive
hm. maybe the players can not open something like the video or audio device. i usually use vlc. there you can open a "messages" box. i'd check there for error messages
vlc wouldn't play them either
hello, I have a problem, I installed ubuntu and updated it, well as soon as I started to use firefox or chrome all my downloads suddenly stops and says network error, what should I do?
Are you using wifi and lost the signal?
well I use wifi and yes sometimes I lost conection
So, might this be the issue?
but I do not lose conection when I'm downloading.  couldn't it be the driver?
what driver, if working not like;y to just fail during use..  What kind of download and can you just restart it?
yes, i can restart it, but still download crashes, files bigger than 5MB I think, cuz I downloaded a PDF about 400Kb and there was no problem, but google talk plugin (deb package) I couldn't
Blargh.
nobody to eliminate ?
Tried updating to blam-1.6.1 manually.. No work. So back to 1.4 for me
oh dear
Weird errors and not even google found anything.. So I'll use the blam package.. wait.... Ubuntu uses 1.6 now. Yay
why build it then
I thought hoary used 1.4 (which it did, for awhile) which uses a bad rendering engine that hangs on images. In 1.6 they switched to gtkmozembed which proved to be much faster.

how good is the Synaptic Package Manager for finding drivers?
most drivers should have been autodetected upon install, but ... it should have whatever you're looking for
Nope, I'm having trouble with my wireless drivers. It really sucks.

Yep.

It's set to Enabled but Not in use.
can you set it to be in use? :X
not as far as I can tell.. I think what I have to do is switch the ipw to the iwl.. or something like that.. I've made a post about it here: <> or something like that.. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=621347. there.. I hate my copy pasta. it always fails

i am on the live cd.  i am on it right nwo using fedora....  do you mean windows live cd?
download and run this http://sourceforge.net/projects/bootinfoscript/files/latest/download
or the fedora boot up.  it gave me an error, i cannot download.  okay it is downloaded.  now what?
you need to run it. so open a terminal type "cd ~/Downloads" and then "ls" what does it say?
hold on.  it is just waiting.  i did cd ~/Downloads and then ls and it is waiting for a command i guess
are you pressing enter after the commands
yes.  it was 2 commands right?.  it got me into the downloads one
yes. do you know what folder it downloaded to?
not exactly sure
can you open the downloads dialog in firefox and find out
it is in a folder named temp
hi - quick question. is there a way of upgrading directly from 9.10 to 11.04?. just i avoided 10.04 because i heard there were 'issues'
I dont believe so
clean install it is then
that is always the preferred way :) then you can be sure,, if anything is buggy , that it was not cuased by an upgrade glitch
someone i know upgraded and it didn't like his nvidia card. caused him hours of grief
Hey, I'm running 17.04 with a Intel kabylake processor, and there's horrible screen tearing when scrolling through opera/chrome. hexchat also flickers sometimes, and it's getting annoying. Is there a solution?
there's a couple of config options to fix it, at least for older releases.  have you created any xorg config yourself?.  put this content in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/xorg.conf and re-login to your system https://pastebin.com/raw/fsW2dacB
I have not
i really dunno what i did that would screw up the drivers like this :/
open that file to edit with nano or whatever you prefer
ok...
actually, if xorg.conf is renamed to .bak will it be automagically regenerated?. that is, move xorg.conf out of the way
kk.  and now restart?
if you rename it to xorg.conf.bak xorg will attempt to automatically detect your hardware. I've had reasonable results but mileage may vary.  yea restart
ok.  rebooting...
ok, fingers crossed
yeah :/.  oh lol....  detection worked by the look of it. but i see what caused the problem. its booted into KDE. :P.  can i ask you a few questions about x and ubuntu quick?
have found 'modutils'. that's all though
mmmmm. that all i can help  sry. even i have a problem because i have 5.1 and only from 2 spks sound comes out
i get as far as 'alsamixer' highlighted but am not sure what to do next
NFSv4 support seems quite alpha in Ubuntu (not working in reality). What other networked filesystem would you recommand in a mixed OS environment (Ubuntu, Mandrake, MacOSX) to provide users with secured and roaming home dirs and netork shares secured acces to groups ?
NFSv3 ?
I already set up a Kerberos KDC and had to verride ubuntu libpam-krb5 with a debian one because of a bug in password changes.
basically filesharing still sucks :(
NFSv4 provide no security at all though. NFSv3 I mean
true

hey guys my nautilus hangs when I start a folder of any kind and takes 20 seconds or something to start, any ideas why ?
could be a broken network mount?.  does "df" or "mount" in a terminal hang as well?
when I start a program called files, without opening any specific network, just the home directory.  nope they dont hang
well, if it's nautilus hanging, it may still be a broken mount even if you're not using it
where would that mount be ? how do I remove it ?
hey is there a command like in windows u press ctrl+alt+del when ur pc freezes?. for when my ubunt ufreezes
keep alt + printscreen pressed while typing the word "reisud"
i heardo f like alt ctrl f1 but that led me to a black and white screen and i couldnt get back yo my desktop. blackfate what doesi t do?
to go back to desktop from alt control f1 press alt control f7 or f9.  the reisud thing i told tou is the way to reboot pc if you get stuck
oh i have to rebooti t?
reisub*.  IF tou ever need to reboot it
therei s no way it can just like similar to task manager in windows lol?
what do i do to make a network between my computers??? laptop (wireless) - desktop - router
you'll have to set the IP addresses, if the wireless stuff works
how? i am on the wireless laptop right now.. what do i do so it sees the desktop?
oh.  so, umm... "sees the desktop". :).  I really don't know your network configuration.  and I'm in a bit of a hurry... but basically you'll have to see the machines' ip addresses from some of the ubuntu menus.  and then try the connection between the machines from the other machine by pinging the other one. :).  that is, ping <ip address here>
Haukari_: ok... ahhh.  at least u gave me a start :)
is there a way to confirm that my processor is running dual core as it should?

thanks. this is a stock dapper install. do I need to install the SMP kernel?
i was right, here on a 4 proc machine it shows 4cpu's in /proc/cpuinfo
did you install the SMP kernel
does ubuntu still use the contents of /etc/network/interfaces?. when I change the settings in the GUI interface inside ubuntu, the contents of that file doesn't appear to change
interfaces is used by ifupdown, your gui is networkmanager. different jobs
i see. so with a default ubuntu install, is there a file i can edit (through an SSH session) to control the networking config? i'm admining some laptops remotely, an i really don't like using VNC. i'd much rather just SSH, and I'm used to admining boxes which i've built using debian netinstall and built up from there.
sorry no clue, i don't use/like networkmanager, but i doubt theres a file to edit
yeah, i can see why ;) thanks for the info. i'll do some reading on network manager. i wonder if it's possible to just remove it and revert to ifupdown
it is.  even wifi can be configured via ifupdown, just needs a little bit more reading maybe
fortunately, we won't need wifi on these machines. they're acting as "portable" server machines running wireshark and ntop. the client moves them from location to location based on where they are having network congestion issues.

looks like something wrong with the partition table, has this computer booted at all since you partitioned the hard drives?
need some serious help, been fighting with lockups (every 1 - 10mins). Tried every kernel option (noapic/noapci/etc), reinstalled 4 times. I *THINK* it's the wireless intel 4565 drivers as it always happens during network usage. Anyone else have this problem?
I have the 4565 card, no problems so far
dang. I'm totally lost then. I have no way to find out what the locks are caused from. :(.  my bad, it's 4965 not 4565.
have you tried testing your ram?
you don't have the 4965, it's 4565 right? :).  0c:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 4965 AG or AGN [Kedron] Network Connection (rev 61)

Hi all - noob question: is there a way for multiple groups to have (different) access to a file?. e.g.: all "admins" have RW, while all "staff" have R

isn't that a security problem?
can i make deb from compiled program?
I don't think so, but you can make a deb during the compiling process.

I don't follow you... you need to compile only once, either way. What do you want to do exactly?
backup deb

hey, is it possible to show space / free space below the desktop icon labels (i found out gconf can put them next to icons but nothing more)
you probably need conky, here is mine: https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Public/conkydesktop.png?w=53bd1e51
thx for the answer but i do not want to do it with conky but just show the free space below the hdd label (made by nautilus itself) if possible
nautilus show free space
next to the icon label on the desktop?.  any idea?
bah using widget, conky, no]
thx anyways, maybe i find a solution, but u know what i want, right (like os x does it)
Ugh, it never finds my AP, but it finds my neighbors, even though I don't get a signal from it
, check if your AP is broadcasting the SSID
Its not, does it need to be?.  It was working in Windowx without it broadcasting.  Its working on my laptop(this computer) without it broadcasting
, yeah... it suppose to work, but that answer the question why you can't see...
Alright thanks I'll go change it.
how do I use fakeroot with alien?
Just use sudo, its less hassle :p
I don't like to use sudo when I don't know exaclty what will happen
It will generate a .deb package from an .rpm. Nothing else.
the why does it need sudo to do that?
Frankly, I don't know.
exactly ;-)
But its not going to take over your system, or hack you. :p
I just tried fakeroot alien file.rpm and it seems to be working

Hey All, I was wondering if anyone else has had problems with the color scheme used in gedit embedded terminal? See http://imagebin.org/192102.. I'm not able to use byobu on linux mint 12 or ubuntu 11.10 due to foreground and background color being the same. Would be great if someones got a fix for this>?
i use byobu, you can change the colors by pressing F9
Thanks for the advice, I haven't been able to change the colour succesfully though to avoid the problem. I'm also getting the same problem with the ls command.
what's the issue with ls?
executable files are being shown as black rectangles, so foreground and background color the same.  see http://imagebin.org/192102
How do I remove gdm from automaticly starting on my server?

thanks for the pointers
Hi there - I'm having trouble getting my /etc/rc.local script to run at startup. Can someone help?
it is ran, did you add the commands you want to run ABOVE the exit 0 line?
http://paste.ubuntu.com/706223/. I already ran "sudo update-rc.d rc.local enable S"
are the files marked as executable?
yes.  would there be any evidence of them running in the dmesg? I know there is an /etc/rc.d/rc.local that calls /etc/rc.local, does it print out to anywhere?
all you need to do is add the lines, you don't need any update-rc stuffs ;).  are the files readable by all too?
I only ran update-rc because simply adding the lines didn't seem to do anything :/.  yes, the permissions are 755
what are the perms on /etc/rc.local
they're the same. If it helps at all, when I run "sudo /etc/init.d/rc.local start", the script starts normally.
Can't you just add the resolution to your x config file?
Yes, and the X server can just as easily reject it

oh.. thats a bit tricky.  tried with winxp cd?
yes.  i have remnants of grub on here
My /etc/fstab file has /dev/sda3 mounting as /, but when I do df, / shows up as /dev/sdb3. Why might this be?
you really should use UUID or LABEL instead
I have two identical drives (cloned one onto the other with dd) so I think it's having difficulty differentiating them.
because /dev/sd* names are not reliable between kernel upgrades etc
Thanks; unfortunately the UUIDs were copied to a second disk when I cloned with dd, so they appear not to be unique.
labels ftw.  or PARTUUID/LABEL if you use gpt
Thanks; I don't know anything about that but I'll google around.

I cannot orient myself in '.config - Linux Kernel v2.6.24.3 Configuration' Where would I find there the line CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y?
just search for it?
What do you mean by "just search"?
well, in most apps you can search inside a file for stuff.  just open the file in a texteditor that can, if this is a textfile which I assume
Excellent! I am speaking about a program and not a file.
okay, then what program? or is the program called ".config".  or am I tlaking to the wrong person here? (goes checking)
The program's name is '.config - Linux Kernel v2.6.24.3 Configuration'. I have clearly stated that in my question at the outset.
can anyone give us a hand with wifi setup pls ;)
what iwconfig says?
iwconfig lists eth1 as the wireless adapter, ieee 802.11b. but. it isnt associated with any networks yet
set up essid for wifi card. iwconfig eth1 essid something
the essid of the access point (along with the keys im guessing)
yes
see. i tried that, and it throws a "SET failed on device eth1; Operation not permitted". which strikes me as a bit odd

are you low on battery ?
I'm not in low battery, it happens everytime. I followed this https://wiki.albany.edu/display/public/askit/Connecting+to+WiUAlbany+-+Linux+-+Detailed

if i run a script in rc.local, will it get executed before the init.d scripts and Upstart services are started?
rc.local will be executed @ the end ... so after all other scripts and services.
hmm, that's not good in my case. I would like a script to execute when the network is available, but before the services are started (apache, supervisor, etc, ...).  when/where should I run my script then? :)
You would have to create an upstart-'service' that runs the script... I guess...
ok, I'll look it up :) thanks.  by the way it doesn't need to run forever, it's only an update/install script for a mercurial repo
./configure && make. Skt: what happens if you run that?. I HAVE A SHIFT KEY!. skt: I asked you what error it gave you, and you didn't answer.. skt: it doesn't work with what error?
Arrenlex: thanks but I don-t understand, this is my line sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /mnt/ubunturoot what should I change
sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/ubunturoot -o umask=000.  does that not work?
Arrenlex: I got a error : mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda1,
are you sure /dev/hda1 is an ext3 partition, then? Are you trying with the -t key or without it?
Hi. I want to set up a remote server for web development, multiuser but I don't know what is best to use for file editing from each user's machine: SSHFS or NFSv4. Any suggestion pls?
nfs is pretty much transparent for the user, and better performing i would imagine.
the issue with NFS is that on the remote machine a user has the name of mikedoug (UID 1004) and on local (his machine) has UID 1001 or 1000, username mike

use names instead of numbers -- i am not sure numbers are valid .. or i've never seen them used this way.  for this script .. you can use a global variable
ok that made no difference?

hi everybody, just a quick question: i have a laptop with a built in webcam and I know if I'm using windows, I run the risk of somebody turning on my cam remotely without me knowing if I have a spyware or something. I shouldn't worry about that in linux?
put a piece of duct tape over the camera if it bothers you. you do technically run the same risk..  i use the duct tape solution myself for all OS ;)
fcuk!!! i do use the cam sometimes. i'll consider putting a duct tape. i rarely go on it as root and don't you need root access to do any major changes. i install software from the repos and that's it.  so, shouldn't i be a little more safe?

my karmic isnt booting, any ideas how to troubleshoot it?. In Eastern beliefs, the karmic effects of all deeds are viewed as actively shaping past, present, and future experiences. The results or 'fruits' of actions ...?
boot to liveCD or installed karmic?
installed, its suddenly stopped booting at an early stage. "starting apparmor profile" etc.  first it stopped upon "Loading cpufreq modules" which I deactivated, this didnt help, so I assume its the step after that
edit the boot options in grub with e to edit the boot to not show the boot splash so you can see whats going on
I would really just like to know how to troubleshoot it...  It does turn off splash at the end, showing where its failed... you mean quiet=no

Some people are serious about gnibbles, lol
if you're talking about the one that said it's __CRUCIAL__, that's yours truly
if it's *that* serious, just recompile it?
I tried, I have no idea how. Isn't this supposed to be linux for human beings? Just saying..  we can continue this in #ubuntu-offtopic, if you'd like :)
no thx, I'm just saying, you should just recompile your game if it's that serious
want to help me? It's not as easy as it looks. I'd have to recompile the whole gnome-games, because the gnibbles package doesn't have its own makefile, etc. not to mention I am on a netbook, so the time involved in doing that would be crazy
nah, it's been 3+ years since I compiled gnome, wouldn't be of so much help
Hi all. I now have my wifi showing connected at 102MB/s, however transferring files is deathly slow. could this be due to using SSH connection for file transfer? Would encryption be the issue?

What exactly are the differences between drivers from the Nvidia site and the ones obtained from ubuntu? Is it an older version of the driver that was just tested by ubuntu to work properly ?
might be older, might be the same. It's just the nvidia driver as a package
So, in actuality, if i didn't mind removing the driver before updating the kernal in the future, i may see better performance or less bugs by downloading the official nvidia drivers?

hey. Im working on setting up grub and trying to figure out the root line. Linux says the hard drive is hdb1. How do I change that to hd0 etc?
hd(1,0) (counting from 0 for each)
i know about that. However i have two disks and i need to figure out where my windows partition is for GRUB.
sudo fdisk -l
that returns info in hdb2.  It does not return where the NTFS partition is.
fdisk -l should list every partition on all fixed drives; one of them should be marked as ntfs or vfat on the right
i started up GParted. That says its hdb1
then it would be hd(1,0)
so i take it its (hd1,0)
erm,  :)
yeah... That's what it says in my GRUB startup. But it just displays a bunch of random characters..  The whole problem may have been that i had the ( right before the hd instead of next to the 1.
no, you wer right, that's what the erm was ;)
well shit. That means it doesn't work right.
does your grub stanza look similar to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26506/ ?
all but the save default

hoping for help, but not quite for ubuntu, any clue about this message while trying to start Transmission on my DNS 343 i get this error: evmap.c:401: Assertion ctx failed in evmap_io_active
what is DNS 341? the error seems to indicate that the context of a map, ie. key -> value structure, is invalid at the moment when this code is trying to do something, eg. alter, the map in question.
DNS 343 is a Dlink 4 bay nas, with Fonz Fun Plug installed... linux yes, ubuntu no... their channel has no one active for help, and the forum is SLOW....  so you think the command used to initialize Transmission might have bad input (map?)

this isn't an ubuntu-specific question, but is there a way to get gnome-do to add certain arguments when launching? for example, when i launch Chrome from gnome-do, i want it to launch like "chrome --enable-plugins" instead of just "chrome"

hm, even after putting the right arguments in the menu shortcut, and re-starting gnome-do, it still seems to just launch "chrome"

you should try ctrl-backspace before a restart. that'll restart the xserver. if that doesn't work there is a key combination sequence that is useful, in not losing data i could get you a link if you want
once it goes out I can't do anything

well Ive got one nvidia and one ati or intel/generic. Ive got a couple of spare ones. both are really old though, compared to my nvidia one
I never could get WPA to work right.
I'll let you know. I'm going to try it in a few minutes.
np. I just don't use it. I got annoyed after following the instructions and still encountering problems, so I gave up.
Yeah, it was a pain in the arse.
pretty much. It was really discouraging given I followed the wiki instructs and it still didn't work.
Wireless still has a way to go in and distro of Linux.. IMHO.. s/and/any/
yeah, I don't find as slick of implementations, in particular with wpa.  that was just a really annoying issue to me....
essal, I did that with my old system and some stuff worked in strange ways :/. Still I guess i can give it a try
may be the difference in program versions.  I'd take it one at a time
I'll try that . Thanks for the answer!
oh look, drive poofed again
check 'dmesg; output.. and i have seen cases where you must 'reboot' then format. after repartitioning. because the kernel can still somehow rember/use the old partition tables.
dr_willis I'm thinking there is something wrong with the disk maybe... sometimes when I reboot it still doesn't see it
ive found that hard drives are the 'weakest' link. these days
dr_willis ocz vertex, I had just flashed it to 1.6, the flash disk sees it every time... but live cds are having a hard time
watch dmesg out put for various messages about it. you could 'zero' the drive with dd, as an extreme way to try to hammer it into submission..  its one of those new 'sdd' type disks?
dr_willis decided to flash the disk, then afterwards (everything seemed fine) upgrade from 9.10 to 10.04... that's where I went wrong, upgrades hate me
or what do youy mean by 'flash the disk' ?
dr_willis yeah, it's a ssd... but I've had NO problems with it for almost a year. dr_willis firmware upgrade
ive never even seen a SDD. so cant help then. Could be some bug. I need space. not speed. :)
dr_willis the 4TB lvm/raid array is for storage :P
ive found in the past.. i do better if i keep things simple. :) no more raids for me. or other fancy things..  i got 5+TB in slow external usb hd's :)
dr_willis it's got to be the drive... this time bios isn't seeing it
Hey Everyone - I am trying to setup some shared in Samba but getting some authentification issues - ive tried the samba channel - but there just confusing me! Can someone spare 5 minutes to walk me through it?
what exactly do you need
Just want to setup 2 shares one for music and one for films for our home network - but with user authentification (so i can write changes to the share but others cant!)
have you added users to samba?
sure have - they just point me to a Wiki where i get highly confused, bang my fist on the table a few times and throw the computer out the window in frstration
lol thats ok
ive set the shares up and can access them fine - but cant write to them. Once i change the authentification mode - i get all sorts of problems :(
you can easily assign shares via the gui as well
Theres a GUI!? (ive been using webmin!!)
actually the gui just allows normal sharing access to the folders
N00b Question here - but will that still work for windows clients?? (with authentification)
the webmin is more precise but if you want to just have users to just have normal read access.  yup they just have to type the username and password (you will need to create another user on your box, though)
Awesome - is the gui pre-installed or a seperate install requirement?
all i've done is typed, samba in the synaptic package installer and installed samba
Ok - which i have done - wheres the client to configure it?
I'm trying to get a webcam to work on my friend's computer. I'm not sure what drivers it needs, but it works in xawtv and cheese, but not camorama or kopete. She needs it for kopete mostly.
try it in ekiga.. similar to kopete
I will. HOld on..  it works in ekiga..  I also used the lsusb command and it's detected fine.
good.. either there is an issue with kopete or it's not setup correcty
but why wouldn't it work with camorama?
that is kopete isn't setup correctly.. there are typically two different codecs for a web cam.. v4l & v4l2 or something like that
alright. So if I install those codecs, do they communicate with kopete? Or are those just webcam drivers like gspca or somethings like that?
neither.. those two should already be options in kopete.. they are 'video types"
alright. I just searched for it using synaptic. I found library files, etc. Which is the package I should install?
also kopete might be looking at the wrong mount point for the camera...  see my post before your last
alright. That makes sense. Hold on.
in ekiga it's listed as a "video plugin". not sure how kopete lists it.
I have no idea how to configure Kopete for webcam use. Or if there are any plugins that need to be added. I remember something about jabber or jasper being mentioned in errors I used to get in previous Ubuntu versions in Kopete webcams..  let me open kopete and I will tell you what it's reading..  after opening kopete, I went to the Video tab under configure and it is reading the device as CIF Single Chip and the input is pac207. I don't know what any of that means, but the screen on top is pitch black..  when I chat with someone else and invite them to view my webcam, it just doesn't do anything.
there should be a properties or setup option for configuring the video .. check there.
alright. Hold on.

dakotawolfy, I installed all but those three packages didn't install. Could this be the problem?
dont think that a problem. wont cause kernel not to work right.  those files are the ones that keep your kernel up to date. and runs the new kernel after it is installed
ohh ok. actually the 38 kernel didn't install.
did u select it.  try the 38.  if it works. then go ahead and after u are running it and hit apply updates and should install those files. .  think the reason is because u manually picked and running the 36 now
sorry. had to refresh the page..  I dont have the kernel 38 installed. Id didn't install.
sorry u d/l it but did not install ???
OK, I'm now installing the 38...
ok.  then boot in to it see if it works if it does then do an update when u are in the new kernel then it should install tose 3 files.  apply
wow, weirdest thing. It works and didn't even have to rebuild nVidia drivers (been having the drivers not work upon every kernel update). It seems that something processed half way and it got stuck in the middle... It seems to be working now. YAY!!!!.  yes, everything is working again. Even WiFi.Thank you very much!
ok now see if those other update far u. those update the kernel and boot u into the newest one.  n/p
actually I had to explicitly state that I wanted to apt-get install linux-generic linux-header-generic linux-image-generic

General type of mail configuration: No configuration ; Internet Site ; Internet with smarthost ; Satellite system ; Local only ............When i'm installing rkhunter , i stuck in this options .Can any one explain me what are this option for ?
you should know what you are doing.  as I said to fluffy do not use rkhunter
: thats why i'm asking
it is a waste of time and will provide false results, don't go looking for rootkits unless you have reason to believe there is a problem
: ok , i will but please explain this mail confgiguration to me
you don't need the mail configuration if you are not using rkhunter.  so you don't need to worry about it
: please ,i'm begging you
press cancel so the package doesn't install, that's what you need
: i want to know what are they for
they are for different types of mail server setups, you are running non of them, so don't need to worry
: what is smarthost ?
a mail config you are not running
: please ! i'm going to cry now

check that portmap is running. `rpcinfo -p`. I meant check that portmap is running on the client.
it is, that was output from the client.
oh, why is your client running mountd,nfs,and status? that is not necessary.
because I tried to get nfs to work.. still doesn't.
from the client run `rpcinfo -p <server>`
it just sits there, no output
That is your problem, your server is not responding to portmap requests from the client. firewall??
no firewall :/
try running `rpcinfo -p` on the server.
ok tried vlc it crashed too. i think it may have something to do with video but not sure.. video card

these are showing various power-saving-states of your hardware, numbers greater than zero mean things like the screen being dimmed or the processor running slower
what does it mean? cooling 3: Fan 0 of 1 ?.  sorry i am confused :-(
in that particular case, it's saying the 3rd fan on your computer is turned off, on would be 1

does anyone know the difference between dapper and dapper-updates?
krakensden: dapper holds the complete archives in release state and dapper-updates features non-security-related bugfixes

krakensden: let me show you my sources.list. krakensden: http://rafb.net/paste/results/WWKmI285.html. krakensden: depending on where you are, you should change the de.archive into something near you
thanks.  I figured ;)

is the plf still extant?
anybody around able to help with a refresh rate issue yet, please?
do you mean in X? you can find monitor(screen) setting in Preferences menu
No. This is happening before X. I have set xrandr to disregard the rate, although it is still evident in text mode (whilst booting up)
are you using kernel mode setting?.  if so, you can use kernel parameter "video=" options
No. There is a bug with KMS on my video chip
if not, I guess you will have to rely on old framebuffer drivers, no a pleasant way, with vga= settings
eww, but if that is the only way, then so be it. Thanks. Out of curiosity, though. Where is the rate set as things stand right now? Is it read from the EDID before X loads? I am thinking along the lines of changing it manually, as it is obviously set -somewhere-
I'm not sure, but kernel has lower level video control
You think it is possible I set the configuration incorrectly when I configured the kernel?
if it works with default ubuntu livecd, then, you know for sure, something wrong with your kernel
Good point. Thanks for your help
for me, the ubuntu livecd gives me blank screen, so I know my kernel is better
Yeah, I had to roll my own kernel on this box owing to a 2 year old kernel bug, so I can totally identify with that. @ KMS basically wedges my GPU
what bug, do you get a bts link for it?

thx, ill give it a try, i just need it to run with cron...

how do i change the indicator applets i ubuntu 12.04??
change them how?. The icons, which are shown or something else?
ya, the icons
Do you know how to change icons normally?
like there is this universal access settings applet which i want to remove, or even the battery icon is showing only a graphical battery.  no i don't
Are you using gnome or unity?
gnome
I see, sec.  go here: https://extensions.gnome.org/ then find "remove accessibilty". there should be sort of an enable button on the webpage, enable it, and it should go away. Gnome is a bit odd when it comes to the indicator applets
does this site now work in chrome?
It should. https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/112/remove-accesibility/ this is it
btw the other extensions which i had installed through this site earlier in 11.10 are now all showing an outdate icon before them.. what does that mean?
hello all, im looking for a way to activate the window-decoration again, when its deactivated by rightclick in titlebar, in lxde/openbox...thank you for help
Did you try to use the Windows button and "t"?
not yet but ill try it.  windows-button and t doesnt help
Hmm, weird, it is supposed to be the shortcut for Openbox on Window decoration.  http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:FAQ#How_do_I_remove_the_decorations_from_all_my_windows.3F - I think undoing this might help.  Alt-Shift-s might be also one option... Anyway: http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Actions#ToggleDecorations
thank you ill read it.  thx it helpt. perhaps you have an answer: is there a way to remove the context-menu-entry "decorate/remove decoration"
Not really sorry, I am also have just browsed through the Wiki too... I am using Gnome 2
thank you. i want to set up a desktop office with lxde for testing in daily use by my office ladys and this option costs me an hour experimenting
I understand that, unfortunately I can't help you further. Why don't you leave the decorations, it would make it look nicer
yes thats right, but when im working without decoration, the users cant move the windows in there used way
Oh, I see
todaay they are used to work at gnome 2 on debian squeeze

can you show the full output of apt update etc on paste.ubuntu.com ?. !info libxml2.  there was a recent update to 2.9.3+dfsg1-1ubuntu0.2 on the security repos

Hi Folks!. I try to rotate my bg-image from a shell-script; I use gconftool-2 --set ..... If I gconftool-2 --dump the change in displayed. but not in the UI and the actual image also does not change. any ideas?
Does it work if you do the same change in gconf-editor?
mom, testing.  same behavior it seems like gconftool and gconf-editor use 2 different databases...
So doing it in gconf-editor works, but gconftool doesn't?
NotBot: I heard that this abbreviation is only common under german mmorpg-players... :-)
If so, how are you running the script? Is it a cronjob?
no, both don't work.  only works by using UI
Oh. Hm. Maybe you're changing something in metacity while using compiz or vice versa?
compiz is running for blingbling... :-)
For a quick and dirty way to see what doing it with the UI changes, do the change in the UI, then run find ~ -mmin -2 to see what files have been changed in the last two minutes.
~/.gnome2/backgrounds.xml is changed
julian You want to look at the various entries to see what they say. At the end of the line, you can add the option "splash" to get a splash screen.. julian If the "nosplash" option is on the line, I think you'd have to remove that.. julian The line you're looking for starts with "kernel"...
ok i will look for nosplash but can you give me an example of a line i would put splashon. ok.  i will look for the line that says kernel.  thanks
julian It will look like "kernel /boot/vmlinuz-(numbers here)-generic root=UUID=(long code here) ro quiet splash". julian Only yours would be missing the "splash" part and may have other keywords.. julian You may have to update each boot entry you want it to apply to.
yea i just checked and it does have splash on the right line already
julian ... and there's not a "nosplash" entry?. julian ... and you're sure that's the line you booted from?

yes, last modified is there. You should be able to use that, but I'm no bash scripting hero.

I've got 4GB of unallocated space and I want to give it to /dev/sda5 (my Ubuntu partition). however Qparted won't let me resize the drive. help?
just partition it as /dev/sda6 and mount it seperately. No prob.
the 4GB space isn't formatted yet, and Qparted won't let me format :-/
lemme guess: the 4gb unallocated space is wedged between /sda3 and the start of the extended partitions.
not really sure, LOL. doesn't look like it though. should I upload a screencap?

Hi! I'm trying to understand the output of ldd. Is this binary really relying on multiple versions of the same library? http://pastebin.com/9L66uVHU
which GLIBC version do you have? Find out using "ldd --version" -- it feels like you're running a pre-compiled binary on a system with an older GLIBC than the one it was compiled on, and that's ldd looking for equivalents
I kindof figured that. I'm just trying to figure out what all those version info lines mean. :) ldd --version says: ldd (Ubuntu EGLIBC 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.5) 2.11.1. (Yes. It's old. I should upgrade. Just want to confirm that an upgrade will fix it before I go through the effort.) :p
I'm not an expert, but I think that an upgrade will fix the problem. The lines say things like this: "libc.so.6 (GLIBC_2.2.5) => /lib/libc.so.6", which means that the requirement of some function in libc.so.6 with a GLIBC_2.2.5 version was satisfied by your /lib/libc.so.6 file -- so, no problem at all. But it's the "not found" lines that break it, and upgrading should resolve those runtime dependencies..  as an aside, I like to keep an Ubuntu 10.04 VM around for compiling binaries -- those tend to work pretty well most everywhere.
Ooooh. So the binary is relying on multiple *functions* from those libraries. And some functions were introduced in newer versions of the library? Hence the listing of multiple versions of the same library?
Again, i'm not an expert, but I think it's more that the symbols it's trying to link against in those SO files are versioned, so the linker can't be sure about all of them matching. For example, calling a function X in a different version of a library may or may not produce what you expected. GLIBC tries to be backwards-compatible, so a newer version should run code compiled for an older one, but not the other way around.. so, if you compile a binary on a pretty old system (i used ubuntu 10.04 as an example), you are usually pretty sure that those will find workable implementations on most systems
Hrmmm. OK. I kindof wish there were an "ldd for dummies" book I could read. :p. But it's my bed time. Thanks for your help. :)
hi there guys. so if ur using ubuntu server as a media server, how do u play media on a television?. anyone know?
why would you want a server distro for that purpose??
to use as a media server..... what distro should u use?
that's glibc. You'll want to reboot for that. You should reboot.. no you don't. You want security updates applied promptly, and service availability solved at a higher level than a single server. high uptime == insecure machine
depends on the use case...
Haven't yet seen a usecase that likes vulnerable kernels or glibc :)
still needs to be connected to the net. I have internal servers that it doesn't matter
yes it absolutely does matter
Hi, do i need to do any additional configuration except disable firewall to accept incoming udp-sockets?
please rephrase your question, it is very vague. configuration for what?
i have a server listening/accepting udp-connection at port 5060. But clients can't connect for some reason....  My firewall is disabled, server-app is running. when i listen to the ethernet wire i can hear that the client traffic is sent to the server correctly
hm so the server must be misconfigured somehow
Yea. i think so. I dont know what files to edit :)
what server is it?
its an IP PBX, for sip phone calls.  asterisk
does "man asterisk" give you any info about configuration and/or config files?
yea, the command echoes back a bunch of info in my terminal.

I've changed a bog standard USB mouse to bog standard PS2 mouse. How do I get xorg to recognise it?
change mouse device to /dev/psaux in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
thanks.. doesn't work :/ Maybe this mouse does not support a USB -> PS2 adapter
with PS2 mice quite often you have to reboot (or even powercycle) with the mouse plugged in as the machine starts up before it will work.  I've even had cases where the PS2 mouse wont work without a PS2 keyboard plugged in, and vice versa
I think I did that. I do have a PS2 keboard..  I guess a reboot won't hurt though :).  is there any way before X starts that I can test the mouse device?

I see. So you configured in on the RAID controller or in your BIOS. Then check dmesg, it should show a new device registering upon reboot (probably /dev/sd*)
Yes--I'm not seeing where in dmsg it defines the dev/sd*
do this then, to identify all the /dev/sd* disks - should be possible to see which ones are single HDDs vs the RAID6 array you've just created. hdparm -i /dev/sd*

it doesn't look like my tasks in crontab are running. can i troubleshoot?. or enable crontab in some way. does /etc/crontab need to be enabled in ubuntu?
you just need to enter jobs
enter jobs?. they are there in crontab
Is there a add on for gaim internet messanger to kick or ban user?
you just use irc commands

how can i copy a directory excluding all the "hidden" files? (i.e. the ones that begin with '.')
i thought the hidden files would get copied if you just copy the directory? For example, in the desktop, select the directory, and choose copy. Dont that work? (that is, dont select all the files in the dir, select the directory)
yes, what i'm saying is i want to exclude certain files
wow, you guys just have questions lobbed at you left and right
Yeh, most of them are the same over & ove,r so ubotu has memorised responses ;-)

Anyone know what the best way is to encrypt partitions?
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=120091
thx.  what iis the difference between dm-crypt and using a loop device?
is there some way to do 'hosts'-like associations for domain-name/alias instead of IP/alias? my school uses DHCP and typing "ssh r01ptsmf8.desktop.umr.edu" every time I wanna ssh is a pain
yes you could use 'hosts' :).  it's in /etc/hosts. sudo vi /etc/hosts
/etc/hosts only works for IP/alias
having switched from nvidia graphics with the nvidia driver (please don't ask :P ) to my integrated intel graphics, I'm having trouble with libGL.so not being found. I assume I need to reconfigure some stuff with ld.so.conf or the like - can anyone help?
How did you install and then remove the nvidia driver?
I didn't remove the nvidia driver, just the nvidia card.
Well that's a problem :-)
actually it's only 32-bit programs that can't find libGL.so, the others are fine.  any idea what could be causing this?
You should still remove the nvidia driver..  And reinstall the 32-bit and 64-bit packages of libgl1-mesa-glx
so next time I want to use my nvidia card again I'll have to reinstall it?
gah, I really dont want to have to reinstall ubuntu just to get my graphics working
did you try ctrl+alt+f1?
yes, didn't work
can you boot some rescue cd?
I could burn a live cd, yeah.. what would I be able to do from a live cd?
if you can boot a rescue cd (best to make a CDRW, these things outdate far too quick) (or USB) you can look at /etc/grub/default. since your screen goes black right after grub, there's probably some funky stuff in your kernel bootline
I can edit grub. It boots to grub, just the second I pick any option, even single user made or xforcevesa, I lose a signal.
if there is and you remove it, run update-grub. hmm oh wait for that you need the system to actually run (or chroot). you can boot grub with a custom line. there perhaps you can remove whatever is messing things up. booting some alternative media you could blacklist nvidia, but I don't know if that would work
recover mode worked if I removed $linux_gfx_mode from it. odd
How do I permanently change my preferred DNS server?
you can do it through the network GUI, or you can manually edit your /etc/resolv.conf file and change the IP addresses in there
But when I change it in the GUI tool, it gets changed back whenever I connect to a different access point
thats cos it gets new info from DHCP. if you use DHCP there is no way to stop it getting the DNS info for that interface I dont think
bah. Ok, thanks
you could create a sample resolv.conf file and make a script which replaces your current one with it, then you'd just have to run that each time to save you editing it
nah, that's too much work
how do you delete 1 file from a USB thumbdrive that has 0bytes free (without destroying all the data)
right click, delete?

what changed Iceman?
I guess the eth0 interface was unconfigured. so I just reinstalled the server. while connected to a network
ah, could've easily fixed if you'd been able to see text  :(
yeah, probably. I always get unusual situations, heh
:)
updating the system now /o/
depending on what you want to do with the server you'll probably end up doing very similar to the solution anyway to set a static IP 
I set up my router to give out the same IP. based on MAC
static DHCP leasing, ok
yup
that's one way >8)
you can play mp3 music
yes
uh. i will try

I got a HD4890, running 9.10 with Gnome and many windows redraw really slowly on switching, they are really noticable. Anything I can do about it?
you could try disabling compiz. That may give a big boost. but then you lose lots of eye candy
I have already disabled all visual effects in the appearance menu. (if that is it)
anyone?
those are two seperate functions, try searching for solutions seperatly..  For a fileserver you're probably going to like Samba, and I bet CUPS can handle your printing needs.
Rabitbunny, i knew i wasnt going to find a 'perfect' all in one guide... but yeah even separately....  i managed to install cupsys and can can even administer the printer through the web interface but the test page never prints
nvidia-glx-config couldn't change nv to nvidia
so its fixed now
so i changed it manually.  yes

dont knwo what else we could do. there can be many reasons u cant boot
Thx. I'll try on Ubuntuforums.
hi, anyone know much about gdesklets ?
ask away
I'm getting an error when starting a network monitor... error: http://pastebin.com/600882
have you configged the gdesklet to use the right device, example: eth0
yup. It actually works.... just that it gives me that error every time I load it...
have you tried more then 1 desklet?
I have heaps of others that work fine... I haven't tried a different network monitor, no.
try another one, maybe that one is coded wrong, and are you using eth0 for internet?
will do. yes, I am using eth0

How compatible is the latest version of Oracle VM VirtualBox with Ubuntu 14.04 ?
runs 100%
No networking problems?
not on wifi. I can't speak to ethernet as I never use it.
Alright. Can you guide me to setup my hacking lab??
install ubuntu 14.04.2. Get the latest vbox from oracle. install it. install distro of choice to vbox. configure network passthrough
I face problems configuring the network part.
hello there everyone. I am trying to getsomething of a rule, like that group policy editor of windows, to from now on, do not allow connecting any new usb devices, and only allow the three usb devices that have been connceted to my ubuntu machine and NOTHING else, I also want to not lose access to my usb devices the next time i restart the sytem.. any ideas?. i read somehwre online, that i can use udev, but i really don't know how to use it. am i muted??
it's a tall order, and would be very involved, but it is doable if you have a LOT of time to develop it.
: my man, you mean it is not implemented for ubuntu as of yet?. you mean not letting new usb devices getting connected to the machine is not available for ubuntu?
the system is designed to be user-friendly so it is designed to get things connected without drama.  for what you describe you'd need to develop udev rules to implement an arbitrary security policy.
I have no friends, neither does my laptop, and I am not looking to make any new friends.
try using a security-oriented distro
: because of badusb. can't I am already stuck with ubuntu on my laptop mate. and I love it. I mean ubuntu works way better with my lenovo laptop than any other distro
I just downloaded netbeans.bin, but dont know how tyo install it. I tried chmod it to 755 and then ./netbeans.bin
isn't netbeans avaliable through apt-get?
which just printed "initilizing installshield wizard, extracting installation archive" and then returned me to the prompt.  Ah, forgot about that handy feature.  hmm... the synaptic does not have eny entry on netbeans
ftp blows. what the crap are you using it for
its a web hosting server, FTP is neccesary for clients to upload their sites
let me guess telnet?
GNOME3 is great i dont get people that hate on it.. Unity sucks balls though
I love unity, but thats just my opinion
your opinion sucks then
hello, I installed mozilla-imagezoom. unfortunately it will not fully install or uninstall. I am unable to use synaptic.
try sudo dpkg --force-remove-rinstreq <package>
what would the options be on that command?
I'm not sure what you're asking
usage: sudo -K | -L | -V | -h | -k | -l | -v
ah, none.
it won't work with $sudo --force-remove-rinstreq mozilla-imagezoom
what kind of error message? Package unknown or the like?
usage: sudo -K | -L | -V | -h | -k | -l | -v usage: sudo [-HPSb] [-p prompt] [-u username|#uid] { -e file [...] | -i | -s | <command> }
you missed the most important thing: sudo dpkg --force-remove-rinstreq mozilla-imagezoom (the dpkg command)
lol. ok, I'm a newb at this.
the dpkg command is the command that is doing something, and sudo just lets you do it with adminstrative privileges
understood..  $ sudo dpkg --force-remove-rinsteq mozilla-imagezoom dpkg: unknown force/refuse option `remove-rinsteq'
is /etc/default/keyboard the right place in ubuntu13.04 to do system-wide keyboard layout configuration, or does lightdm have some local overrides of the settings there?. aha, Xorg.0.log has a funny clue: first it shows my XKB options from the default/keyboard, then it says: XKB: reuse xkmfile /var/lib/xkb/server-<lots of hex digits>.xkm. wtf is that .xkm file and who generates it?
apt-file can help you determine that.  or packages.ubuntu.com
actually /var/lib/xkb/README.compile gave a clue... it's a file with compiled XKB maps. I've just stopped my lightdm and about to nuke the xkm files there
but probably some precompiled package uses them, I'd better try to find which and why.  just in case you do an upgrade and they show up again, or later on you get problems when trying to do X with certain package because those files are missing
nope, they're generated by xorg on startup or whenever setxkbmap installs one
oki
OK, nuking the cached XKM files in /var/lib/xkb and starting the X server again didn't help --- even though Xorg.0.log now says "generating" rather than "reusing" the file, it still shows only the optioons I had requested in /etc/default/keyboard as being set for layout selection --- so wtf don't they work under a barebones X session (ratpoison+terminal)?!. "it still shows" -> "the log still shows". omg, I have a nagging suspicion
maybe there is an xorg.conf option you can tweak
on 13.04 unlike 12.04 I don't even see an xorg.conf, just an xorg.conf.failsafe
yes, xorg.conf is not necessary ot get X working but.. you can create it and add specific configuration...
but it is the very same XKB option I already witness as loaded from the Xorg.0.log
it's not my fault :P
could it be there is a client-side keyboard setting configuration cached somewhere in gconf?
how to change username in console?
as run as other user?
example.. I have gregg username and I want to change it to happy.  once logged..what to do next?
It's definitely not running Wayland - I don't have the option. (sorry for delay, took a while to reconnect)
ubuntu = the wayland session, (xorg) the xorg session on gnome
Ah, OK. In that case I've tried both, and both exhibit the same behaviour.. (But the classic versions, compiz & metacity, are fine)
Does anyone know how to change the default in firefox back to mplayer?

hi, always me about difficulties using internet from the console. my steps:i configured /etc/network/interfaces as follow in paste, i set grub to start with console, i set nm-system-settings.conf to disable NetworkManager and i reboot. Once rebooted i check eth1 with ifconfig and it doesn't keep the ip address.. http://paste.ubuntu.com/923023/. The command ifup eth1 gives me the output "interfaces eth1 already configured, ifdown eth1 gives me RTNETLINK answer: No such process-SIOCDELRT: No such process, other time with ifup eth1 is ok and eth1 is set with the ip address. but pinging the server gives me "Destination Unreachable". In pastebin you can see the files /etc/network/interfaces, /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf and /var/log/syslog during the time logged in the console. UNGSANTE password is WPA-PSK[
I was able to make a script with a wpa-supplicant.conf that works for me on a working system in wep, but I don't have a wpa2 capable ap to test the reset. rest
do you think is a problem of wpa-supplicant?
I also noted in my research that my raylink won't work in 11.10 but works fine in 10.04
have you seen the log i paste
it seems for me it's in the drivers for raylink.  I've seen your other logs
network interface?
you config files look like they should work, and that log looks like others that are having this problem
others people?
so solution would be to run the older working kernel and wpa-supplicant match.  yes other people as in http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1857635.  my script that works on 10.04 http://paste.ubuntu.com/923032/
i've 10.10
and example wpa-supplicant.conf for wep http://paste.ubuntu.com/923032/.  so you can try 10.04 iso see if that kernel works for you if so you can install the working kernel in 10.10
mmm, this is new for me, really!. i never work on the kernel. i never worked on the kernel
the kernel is much like a package in ubuntu not much more to it.  I guess you don't need to try the iso just import the kernel package to try it I guess.  if it fails your net or fails to boot you can just pick the original from grub to boot again
i never did it and i don't want make damages!. could you suggest me a guide about this argument please?
other posible solution is to find the working driver set and compile them onto your present kernel.  this is the kernel I now run that works for me: Linux FreeNet 2.6.32-21-generic #32-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 16 08:10:02 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux
which lines on log tells you is a problem of kernel/driver/wpa?
I'm not booted onto my 11.10 so I'm not sure what it has but it's like 3.0.xX.  it's very much a guess I didn't have time to study your logs
ah ok. i posted it on the forum
but if you read the example link you will see some similarities.  yes but I only glanced at it.  and since the only changed that I can see in like wicd that should work in 11.10 didn't cause the problem the kernel did
i don't see similarities between my log and that one you proposed me.. anyway, thanks. hope for the forum
other than wpa didn't work but non encrypted did?
i don't uderstand what you mean
its seems related in the sence that you both have the same simptums that link to not working driver to wpa-supplicant.  as I am now a part of that group since all I have is two raylink rt73 usb devices that don't work past ubuntu 10.04
but the problem you mean is about drivers doesn't work using wpa_supplicant?
I'll later explore using my 10.04 kernel on 11.10 maybe later today.  yes why does your wifi device not work without encryption or have you not yet verified that fact?
you mean to try a free connection?. no password?
I also tried the legacy raylink encryption driver that also don't work in 11.10
11:24 < >  its seems related in the sence that you both have the same simptums that link to not working driver to wpa-supplicant
yes I have my own wifi network so I can experiment on that maybe you don't have that resorce
> a question: i haven't problem using this network interface with network manager, what is the different of use?. between console and X?
oh maybe we are not related then if it works on network-manager maybe that uses legacy not wpa-supplicant, that might be why it works, I'm not sure.  in wicd you can select between legacy and wpa2 ext to posibly verify what is the difference.  or you can try the script I gave you to experment with it, but my rt73 don't have wpa support imbedded in the driver
11:24 < >  its seems related in the sence that you both have the same simptums that link to not working driver to wpa-supplicant
I already read that
am sorry, many problem with electricity. is a mistake. but, how to configure without password?. don't i have to use wpa_supplicant.conf file?
what a typo? it's my problem maybe a part of yours, maybe yours works in lagacy but not wpa-supplicant.  yes I posted my wpa_supplicant.conf file as an example but mine configured to wep,.  maybe you didn't get it??
ok, but setting my wifi network without password how could i do?
my experiments included using wicd.  for that you would need to have admin rights on your access point to turn off encryption
i know, am talking about /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf. how to set no passwd there
I bypassed the /etc/network/interfaces in my script.  I don't want to mess with my system settings I just run different scirpts to get the results I need
ah. you mean you don't know how to configure wpa_supplicant.conf file?
yes I have two wpa-supplicant.conf files I gave you the one I have tested that works.  my script still links to the conf file
but you set a password in wpa_supplicant.conf file i think
intor: wpa-supplicant.conf http://paste.ubuntu.com/923032/ and script that runs it http://paste.ubuntu.com/923032/
are the same files!
yes I set my access point to wep to test it. opps
the same script
No ChanServ?
chanserv is online
It's not in here though, is it. ?
chanserv is not in this channel, no
Because the channel would be registered if it WERE to be here
chanserv is only present in channels that request it. There is really little point in it being here.
I thought it was in all Registered Channels
kk-jonti thats just a assment. kk-jonti it should relern the time after a bit
what can I do for that?
just use it
do you mean there will be an update to the kernel or acpi package? what could be the reason?
kk_jonty that time is only estmated
yes but in my case the estimate is coming almost right..  which is not the right estimate for sure.
batterys ware out. kk_jonty set britness lower turn off wifi/blurtooth/card reader
if that was just a guess then my system hould have stayed on beyond 2 hours but it called off for a system shut down with low battery message
kk_jonty that will get more time from the battery
I am sorry, i did not get what u said?
kk_jonty you probly had more stuff on so it used more power
yes i thought so as well, but this is happening consistently in same situations and workload where I used to get more backup..  the fun part is that I am totally blind and i do turn off my moniter
i can get 5 hrs off my 4 cell with wifi bluetooth sd card reader off
and still no improvements on the battery status
maybe the batterys waring out
I got it just a couple of months back and as I told you on another machine the battery behaves nicely.
wifi can cut your battry time in half
if I asume your idea of waiting for the laptop to learn the real battery power? do you have any idea what is this problem, I mean how does the acpi take time to learn?
sometimes it does have to relern.  but it sounds like the battery needs to be checked
I did
you have a warelevel metor?
went to the service center and they confirmed that the battery has 3% ware means it must give me 3 hours 5 minits battery.  it was their calculation
then wifi is probly taking a hr
and hardy still takes it perfect
they extmate max
I am very sure that this is some kind of an acpi problem. that's why I was wondering if there was some one in the room who could assist me to find a patch if avaliable
probly 3 and a half without wifi on.  if thats a dule core 2hrs sounds right if using wifi.  my hp dies in 2. in windows or linux
wifi was off and it is a r 60 lenovo with dual core
off oe just not connected.  did you tuern it off with the hotkey
hot kye?
key. or switch. depending on the laptop
I have a physical switch which is on the off position
oh. streange
yes .  else you will rarely find me in this room asking usual questions
have you looked on google for some acpi stuff just for your pc
yes
my eee had some scripts. gave me another 2 hrs. on a 4 cell heh
which scripts?
where called eee acpi scripts. just for those thow. i bet acpi isnt underclocking in battery mode. check your power mangment settings
another interesting observation, the command acpi always gives me some strange output like some times it says 4 hours remaining and some times 2 ours. while the function + f3 key gives me consistent 2 hours response..  I wonder whether these 2 outputs are from the same source?.  interesting isn't it?
what laptop was it. lets see what i can find
How do I disable animations in unity desktop?
look into the "unity-tweak-tool"
okay.. Thanks . if i disable the animations will that make the computer slightly faster?
I'm using ndiswrapper if I makes a difference, and the card+router work in windows.
do you get a MAC address with iwconfig?
A MAC address for the the wifi card or for the router? I do get what looks like a MAC address listed under "Access Point" in iwconfig..  Sorry, that last comment was directed at you. I do have what appears to be a MAC address listed under "Access Point" in iwconfig, and of course the wifi card's MAC address is listed in ifconfig
I can't get rtorrent watch command to work..
why not?.  sorry, misread.  you mean where rtorrent watches a folder for torrents?
I uncommented it and gave it the right directory a sample .torrent but it not downloading it.. yes.
all the isos looked good. download went as normal. burning successful. i think the problem might have been a bad sector on the drive.. now that i'm installing to a different hard drive, things are going smooothely
well done
thanks rampage. and thanks for the help last night

i've installed gnome 3 through software manager, it broke my system, no i've removed it, but in lightdm i'm still able to login to gnome. how ca i remove all of gnome?
which release are you using?
12.04
then it comes with Gnome3 by default
i've added a ppa ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3.  actually it only brought unity
why, precise comes with gnome3, why are you adding PPAs?.  Unity is a shell, 12.04 uses Gnome.  Unity is not a replacement for Gnome.  if you install ppa-purge you can remove the ppa and it should reinstall the official gnome3
i removed the ppa from software center. is that ok?
How do I install wodim on a live CD ?. I'm running the live cd but I need to burn a Cd. how do I install a program to do this?

if I share a printer off a Windows XP machine how do I use it from Ubuntu?
if it's shared, it should be auto-detected.
how do I tell if it found it then?.  how do I find out if it found it?
System -> Adminisration -> Printing
nope doesn't see it
on the "Server Settings" tab, make sure "Show printers shared by other systems" is checked
it is.  its not showing up
you're running hardy?
yea
hi everyone... i think i'm logged in somewhere else on my network through NIS... how can i tell which machine i'm logged into?

how do i view/close current terminal sessions?
I just put modprobe alx and dhclient eth0 in rc.local, maybe that wil lwork
Using Network Manager to initialize the wireless?
I got it to work :) I just put modprobe alx and dhclient eth0 in rc.local so it happens ever boot. I guess it's better than nothing. maybe one day Ubuntu will include drivers for this thingy by default.
Yeah, I was just typing that...
I'm in Ubuntu server so no network manager for me, if you're talking about a gui thing.
When you rebooted, did you check to see if the module was loaded before the manual 'modprobe alx'?
No I didn't, I don't know enough to :P. I barely know what I'm doing now. I just learned what blah | grep something did :D. that pipe is neat, chaining commands
Because it might have been loaded and you just need to modify '/etc/network/interfaces' to have it bring up the interface automagically..  Oh, bash one-liners are my favorite..  I'm not sure what device is created by loading the module, but you might also solve your issue, assuming the module is loading, by adding something like 'auto wlan0' and 'iface wlan0 inet dhcp'.
nice, I'll try it
Up to you if you wanna reboot to see if the module is loading.
Another question, it's not very Ubuntu-y, but does anyone know a good dynamic dns service that allows multiple domains to be pointed at one dynamic IP?
anybody knows how to move a panel to another monitor? i got 2
can you drag other windows from one monitor to the other? if so, simply drag the panel to the other monitor.
yeah, i can drag windows, but panel stays in-place.  can't drag it, i tried
try holding down ALT and dragging
thanks mate. and another question about 2 monitors, compiz stopped working..... any reason why compiz shouldn't work with a dual monitor system?
I'm having problems with hibernating. I'm using a Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop. When I hibernate, the machine freezes upon resume, just before the login screen appears. Nothig but physical reset unfreezes it. The mouse pointer won't even move. If I disable compiz, I sometimes manage to hibernate once, but the second time it freezes again. My swap space is 6GB for a 3GB RAM. I've tried to log at the boot log, but shut down seem to go alright,. whereas nothing was written to log upon resume. Anyone knows what might cause this, or what can I do to better diagnoze the problem?. I've searched the forums and google, but didn't find anything relevant that wasn't decreed 'fixed'
<unconvertable>  im also having that problem with my hibernate, doesnt seem to hibernate as well in a proper manner, i think the reason is due to the linux distributions not having the proper drivers used in DELL inspiron
You too, eh? Suspend works great, but hibernate breaks, right?
<unconvertable>  yeah, i think its a dell issue
Damn.
wewt i got dual screens to work. anyone here got a moment to help me out?
what is your issue?

Hi everyone, i have a dual video card laptop, and because of that, ubuntu only sees the more basic one. How can i switch to the advanced one?
Post the manufacturer and model of the computer when you ask a hardware question. You're more likely to get an answer if you do.
i have a Acer Aspire timeline X 5820tg 6406, with an ATI radeon HD 6550m.
hi. I plan to buy the "HP Pavilion HPE-140ch, i7 860, 8GB, Blu-ray" desktop
bad idae
how do I find out if it is compatible? what about the blueray drive? network card? sound card? nVidia GeForce GTX260SE?
idea*
hmm why?
If I install 5.04, is it possible to update the system to 5.10 or 6.06 automatically while the system is running?
yes, but it will require a reboot
but will it require manual configuration on my part?
hey guys, I'm having quite a problem with ssh
What's the problem?
I have two users on my server, and one user on my client. The problem is that I use key logins, and for both users on the server, it prompts me for the same rsa keyphrase!.  I have separate keys for each user on the server... but it just prompts me for one key every time...
i need help with my cron.. i made a cron to run in intervals in ubuntu 8. no im upgraded to 10.04 lts and cannot get crontab -e to work. it just returns a nuber
try sudo crontab -e
it returns 868
when you do a sudo crontab -e ?
no crontab for root - using an empty one. 29
hmm dunno -- it works priv/unpriv for me.
i made a cron file a while back on 8.  now I am getting emails set from my script. all over sudden. There is a .sh tied to cron somewhere that updates my IP.  how do I look into that crob job?
How does one list installed packages that have "vim" in thier names?

how can i see what driver i need for my wifi to work? im currently on wifi, but ill do a fresh 10.04 install and it prob wont find my wifi card again
lshw -C Network | grep driver | grep wireless
it displays nothing. !fr
plain <unconvertable> sudo lshw -C Network <unconvertable> ?
i got some output now
i wrote a contab for rtcwake and entered it with crontab -e but it didnt run
if you run: crontab -l , do you see the crontab you added?
i see my 3 ones  did it type them right. 0 0 * * 2,3,4,5,1 sudo rtcwake -l -s 108000 -m mem. 0 7 * * 2,3,4,5,1 sudo rtcwake -l -s 28800 -m mem. 0 0 * * 1,0,6 pmi action suspend
you cant add sudo to cron
so do i just remove sudo from it
you need to run: sudo crontab -e , to edit root's crontab and add the commands without sudo
and  the 3rd line should have ran last night at midnight and it didnt
if the commands need sudo to work, you need to cron as root, not your user
0 0 * * 2,3,4,5,1 rtcwake -l -s 108000 -m mem. 0 7 * * 2,3,4,5,1 rtcwake -l -s 28800 -m mem. 0 0 * * 1,0,6 pmi action suspend. and  how do i do that
do what?
root
can you share files with linux and windows
yes
how? im trying to share a whole ntfs partition with windows
I am trying to reset my localhost mysql root password. When I start the mysqld via systemd the socket file is created fine in /var/run/mysql but if I launch mysqld_safe manually it errors out do I need to manually make /var/run/mysql ?
@ Does it work when you connect via tcp/ip or is networking disabled?
its a local mysqld so networking shouldnt matter
@ Well, if it is not listening on a file socket, maybe you can connect via TCP/IP - `mysql -h 127.0.0.1` is your friend
If I so "systemctl start mysql.service" the socket file is created and all is well if I top the service via "systemctl stop mysql.service" and then relaunch it in a root shell (sudo -i) it fails even as root to create the socket file it errors out like this http://paste.opensuse.org/view/raw/71bdfb36
@ What does the log file say?
danielhuman: I am trying to follow along with https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MysqlPasswordReset the same happens with.  how do I check. I mean what file to I cat/less/more/grep ?. *do I
well, check your screen output, you just posted, and take an educated guess ;)
my educated guess is starting the mysqld manually is not creating the /var/run/mysql folder and the socket file. but shouldnt this be automatically done by just launching the mysqld ?
I can't seem to figure out how to map the caps lock key to ctrl on 15.04. Any clues?
haven't tried 15.04 yet but you may want to check out xbindkeys I've used it for some key mapping stuff before.  ah take it back just looked that up again, recall now I was just using that for keybindings to do various operations for the window manager, not mapping keys
yeah looks like I can run commands to key bindings. hmm
Okay. So. Something is keeping my Windows partition busy so it can't be unmounted. Seems to be an X process. I'm now out of X, thanks, sitting in irssi in the terminal, but I have no idea what process is keeping the devide busy.
try lsof, that gives you the process
pretty. so if i find my windows partition to the right, that's the application using it? because if so, it's irssi, which i just started... and i couldn't unmount before that either
do you have a terminal open, where you are in the windows-directory?. oh. gone. nice.
Yeah, okay, quitting irssi didn't help at all :P. I don't want to shut down without safely unmounting the partition, last time I did that I corrupted a lot of files
what says lsof <where your windows partition is>
bash and irssi. bash is because i'm attempting to unmount i guess. and irssi, i have no idea, but i just quit it and that didn't help
wah, if my english was a little bit better.. but anyhow, i think you have a terminal open, where you sit in your windows-partition....  ?
Hmm, I don't have any terminals accessing the win partition.  Maybe some unlisted X applications or something?. I have no clue
then what says lsof /path/to/your/windows-partition say exactly
I have no idea how to copy-paste in bash... But it says bash and irssi are accessing it, bash probably being lsof itself?.  But I guess I'll just give up... It's 5:15 in the morning :P I'll just shut down without unmounting and hope for the best.  Thanks for the help :)
howdy all...

quick question about copying a partition ... one Dapper to a Breezy... i ran out of space in the dapper partition. can i do it with relative ease? I know the fstab will need repair .. but everything is in hda7 and needs to be in hda2 which is bigger. does that make sense?. i know dd can work on a running system, but will it work for such a copy?
yes. best to use a tar pipe probably
how?. never done that
"tar -cf - /mnt/olddrive | tar -xf - -C /mnt/newdrivetty23"
i usually do dd if=/dev/part1 of=/dev/part2.  so that is quicker?
not as fast probably but it won't resize the partition either :)
oh... so it will just compress, then extract it back into the new larger ... ic... first one is 3gb ...target is 15gb.  i would guess ghost or trueimage would do it faster, but they are $$$
dd will make an exact copy of the partition. i.e. same size. a tar pipe preserves links and permissions but actually copies the files
cool. well, let me free some space and try it. =D. thanks
how to remove a package like openbox with all its dependencies ?. for example openbox does install others apps
How did you install it?
I install e17 and openbox and it did install a lot of other packages. I don't know how to emove it completely
the fact the source is right.. or because its wrong?
no, you've just made some minor errors ... one sec
ah ok
try this: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/114.  or recopy the one from ubuntuguide.org.  you can cut-and-paste the one from ubuntuguide.org if you prefer
then try install java again?
yeah.  at this point i'll warn you that not everyone thinks backports is all that great

hi do u recommend to install 10.10 or 10.04 ????
yes
yes what?
yes, I recommend to install 10.10 or 10.04
both????
peaction, ok
so there's one partition, partition 0 on device sdb, so mount /dev/sdb0 /media/HDD (if /media/HDD is the mointpoint)
ok hold on please
if it works, nothing will appear to happen, but you will be able to 'ls -l /media/HDD'
mount: special device /dev/sdb0 does not exist
sorry, it's partition 1, not partition 0. notice in the info you pasted me?
yes.  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50063/

hello hello! how to...... how to show the information of music which is playing with amarok on pidgin's label?
trying pidgin plugin
which?
sorry i have one more question: when i run dpkg -i skype.deb to istall it, it errors out due to dependencies. is there a switch i can use to recursive install all the required stuff?
that's where apt-get comes into play
but apt-get install skype.deb doesnt work of course
yes! I did it!. X wouldn't start but then I used my crazy mad hacking skills to download the package that I need :P. now, is there a binary of Pidgin anywhere? I have no idea how to compile the source and it's not on pidgin.im or in the repos
is the gaim package linked to it?
not sre. *not sure

anyone here knows a good tutorial for (mobility) radeon hd 5xxx series driver installations? xserver isnt starting after driver installation (fglrx) and reboot. it reboots in tty1. i googled myself to death, cant find good tutorials or solutions so far
check log files.  I don't know which log files those are in particular, but you should figure out which ones are relevant and check them
hm ok thx
also, xorg gives some output when you start it with startx
while googleling i found out that alot of people have driver issues, especially with the 5000 series... so i thought there might be some good hints or tutorials out :(
so you can do startx from a terminal, then switch back to it and see the output
ok thank you =)

hello, since yesterday. i have a proc klogd running 100% of my cpu. i wonder what exactly it does and should i kill it?
It's the kernel log daemon. It shouldn't be consuming much CPU time.
hmm i have killed it butc what cause it use 100% cpu....  could it be cause of an attack?
hi!. is anybody familiar with smnp, rhhd, mrtg, or anything similiar?. rrd*. Well, what are some tools to graph network usage?. ;)

it was working but since I switched to a wired network and back I can't get it to work again without using wired
-> do this, when it works, right down the contents of ifconfig; iwconfig; route -n ; cat /etc/resolv.conf;
I don't think that will fix it, I think it's some bug in nm. it seems hard coded to use eth0. yet it was working until the first time I plugged it in. eh. and now it has worked again. this is weird
11.04 is really slow and weird. i'm having some strange problems. i wish I didn't upgrade now.
describe them
i'm trying but having difficulty....  the biggest problem is there seems to be this huge drag on the system.
like lag?
everythign seems.. slow... playing music gets gitttery.. when i switch virtual desktops
using unity?
no, kde..  this is a 16gb of ram, 6 core machine.. it shouldn't seem laggy!
monitor a process/activity monitor see what's consuming the cpu
i did that.... folding at home is using a lot of cpu (but it runs in idle so not an issue).  nothin else really shows up
how about ram?
16gb of ram, 8gb in use, no swap..  i have a hunch it's realted to video.. nvidia.. because lots of display changes seems to be linked.. but i can't be sure.
then the only way is to test that, using compiz? disable it, then if no changes swap between no driver, open source and proprietry. before all this though update everything and maybe restart the session or even the pc
my #1 concern is a drive is failing at this moment.. is there any way to test if the problem is IO bound?.  how can you install "different version" of drivers using apt?.  using gentoo I would "emerge nvidia-drivers-version#". but with apt I can't seem to find a way to specifiy a version. i'd like to downgrade. or upgrade. and see if it makes a diff
unistall proprietry then use 'nouveau'. !nouveau
i really don't want to give up 3d, it would be a majorpita..  but using a diff version # would work, is this possible?
Question about the upgrade from tar 1.26 (in 12.04) to tar 1.27 (14.04). The release notes say this:. https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Y5i5zPW0. Does that now mean that --skip-old-files is what -k *used* to be?
no. keep old files made a error 2 out of duplicates on exiting. -skip old files now just skips them without error.  both dont override duplicates, but the old one made a drama, the new one just skips.
wait, what?.  I know the difference between --skip- and --keep-old-files now in 1.27. My question is this: as far as I can tell from reading the messages, --skip-old-files in 1.27 is equivalent to -k/--keep-old-files **in 1.26**.. Is that incorrect?
hello, i've got a problem with evolution connecting to a citadel email server.
what protocol?
imap
so you have a problem making imap connection using evolution. standard imap, port 143?
yes, but also doesn't work on 465
telnet HOSTNAME 143.  if telnet opens, then: 0 LOGIN username password.  0 is part of command, replace username and password with correct ones
the pure connection is not the problem. it doesn't show any errors and thunderbird is working fine through that port. but evolution doesn't download any mail, although thunderbird does
!DL
it means dual layer. you could burn 8GB to a dvd. you need dual-layer dvds though
wow thats amazing! I was told it didnt support dual layers. but Nero says it does
well, does your drive say DL or dual layer on it?
no idea! its internal
my 'time applet' shows a few calendar entries, where do these come from? and how do I change the calendar used?
do you use evolution, or have it set up to use a calendar? I think that, by default, the calendar entries there gets added to the applet.
I have used evolution but removed it.
i know this isnt exactly the right channel for this, but does anyone know of a gui config utility for Apache?
perfect place, try webmin
i installed that earlier actually. how do I config it?
!info kernel. !package kernel

hmm.. that can't be checked for hardy?
oh.. sorry.. hardy.. no, that's right.. don't remember which one is available for hardy

How did you install your wireless drivers before? ndiswrapper?
No, I just used the networking config and it searched and found them and that ws it.
Does anyone have experience installing grub2 on a standalone partition, solely for the purpose of chainloading to other OSs? - I want to do: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MasterBootLoader#A.284.29_Configuring_the_.22Master_Boot_Loader.22_for_the_First_Time. (I used to be able to do this with legacy grub, but cannot figure out grub2...)
If you have a OS with grub 2 already you can use it.
I prefer to have a standalone "boot master" partition -- such that if the OS that is managing the 'master boot', messes up, I can easily still boot into other OS. the wiki link I refered to outlines the concept

my / =0 1, /boot=0 2, /home=0 2, in my fstab so I was wondering what I should put for my external drive, I dont really understand what its doing
it probably isn't such a great idea to have a fstab entry for removable drive anyway, since you can't really guarantee what device name it will get (unless you do some udev cleverness).
its always been /dev/sda1 when I was in fedora, its my only sata drive so I think I should be safe
external usb drives also take up scsi names, so if an external usb drive grabbed sda, your sata drive might get bumped to sdb..
no I meant the external was sata, internal are all ide

okay I tried the dd method - now it's not recognized by my mac or the netbook
did you make sure to dd your image to a device and not a partition
doesn't this tell me to do it to a partition? http://osxdaily.com/2015/06/05/copy-iso-to-usb-drive-mac-os-x-command/
no idea if OSX does some weird black magics, but the idea is you dd to a device since it will bring MBR with partition layout and bootloader with it
ok will try that. strange that that site says the opposite. thanks for the tip :). also macOS probably doesn't do any black magic - it's standard dd afaik.  that works - thanks so much :)

hi all, just installed 8.04 onto this laptop (please dont ask why 8.04 I have my reasons)....anyway ctrl-alt-bkspace does not restart x....could it be something with this keyboard or is the feature disabled??? Suggestions?
8.04 that's alright, having 8.04
<unconvertable>  so why is ctrl-alt bkspace not working ( i did use displayconfig-gtk to get 1024x768 rez.) Could that have messed something up?
unfortunatlly I don't know about that one, and have you installed the graphics card driver. !repo
<unconvertable>  when I run hardware drivers, I get no proprietary drivers
damn that issue :(. Linux distros are great, but xorg isn't
<unconvertable>  should I try to select different driver when running displayconfig-gtk?

https://pastebin.com/Xn6R9Lur I want to loop over the contents of a directory and perform some action on each file (if it has a particular extension). But what I'm doing currently just echos the name of the directory that I supply as an argument...
the script looks fine, try to quote the $THE_DIR
it seems to work sometimes. but when i supply a directory whose name contains spaces, it just echos each piece of directory path, delimited by the spaces.
one last try. anyone that can explain what gstreamer is and why my sound doesnt work? if i click the sound icon up in the right corner it says that i need a gstreamer plugin, so i have no sound.
have you installed the plugins packages?.  you need to have multiverse and universe to be able to install
ok, shoul i just do "apt-get install gstreamer" ?

- that's cool and all, but what do I do?
got a new laptop to learn to use linux on, it's got bluetooth built in, so I'm thinking of getting a bluetooth mouse, there anything I should be aware of? are they a pain? any brands I should avoid?
Avoid non-common brands as support for those won't be as good.
so anything like logitech, MS should be usable?
Yes this should be fine - go the forums though just to check if any particular models have given trouble.
cheers
what are the main advantages of updating ubunutu

just to start lighttpd at boot
can I rename a sound ?
if it is a .wav file, or any file, for that matter, then yes.  or you can create a link to it so that both names work
no I want to rename the device.  I have 3 cards... 2 are the same
you can rename the /dev node if you like. I'm not sure why you want to, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.
and I have problem in mixer, I belive that is the cards names that is the sabe.  the same
usually the mixer will work with a symlink.  do you know what name the mixer is using?
but the problem is card:0 (Ensoniq PCI), card:1 (Ensoniq PCI)

guys, after an apt-get update and a reboot today, my system is unbootable. After the grub screen, I get a blank screen with a flashing cursor, and then moments later I'm dropped to busybox. Obviously no logs at this stage, but dmesg has messages like "ata1 Failed to identify. I/O Error, err_mask=0x40" or something very close to that, and also "scsi_alloc_dev: allocation failure during scan, some devices might not be configured". I'm b
Those are errors reading the hdd
which would mean the harddrive is bad?
Possibly. Can you boot a liveCD ?.  You can use the live CD to check and possibly repair
which would be odd, because yes, I can boot up to the live cd. I can assemble the software raid groups based on those drives. I can scan for logical volumes, and mount them successfully.
Perhaps it's just having trouble finding the correct hdds. I have never set up a raid but I know they are usually problematic
not sure how I should repair :-/ Not exactly sure what went wrong. I'm tempted to just try to re-install but keep existing partitions/volumes/raid groups.  first time in many years that I've had problem out of raid...not even sure raid is the issue here ;-)

Hey, anyone can help me on the command line to install the following package: bluez (4.101-0ubuntu13) ? When I try "sudo apt-get install bluez4.101-0ubuntu13" I get an error. I really can't figure out what I am doing wrong...checked tons of forum pages. Anytone can help me please on the syntax to install package bluez-4.101-0ubuntu25 ?
which ubuntu version?
15.04
!info bluez.  type sudo apt-get install bluez
I did that already but it tells me that I already have latest package. But I want to downgrade it to 4.101 as the latest one 5.30 messes with my bloothooth card
how did you install the latest one? a ppa?
yes

I don't have Direct Rendering, yet I have XGL running. Can you explain?
What's the output of your glxinfo | grep renderer?
OpenGL renderer string: GeForce 7300 GT/PCI/SSE2/3DNOW!
there you go. You have 3D acceleration..  direct rendering might be something different. Thanks; I'll stop asking for it.
I thought I have XGL and Beryl running. It rusn fantastic. I wanted to build a cheap, ubnuntu friendly computer. Does anyone know a good, cheap wireless card that works with Dapper out of the box. i.e. no driver required. NOx, I would do this. apt-get remove xserver-xorg. then delete. then. apt-get install xserver-xorg. and configure it from scratch
what on earth is the point of that?
To fix his Xserver problem. It worekd for me
since upgrading my system to 13.10 im experiencing serious lag. can someone please help me out?
what kind of lag? Window manager effects? What does the System Monitor tell you about what your processor usage is at?
applications take forever to open, still waiting on system monitor... i was editing a spread sheet in libre and there is serious lag like when i click a cell to edit it. right now system monitor shows almost no cpu load. when i opened firefox compiz jumped to 18%
perhaps it is a GPU-based issue. Anything interesting from the dmesg command in a terminal. Maybe the kernel has something to say.
just times it on my cell phone stop watch from clicking on rhythmbox in the doc to application opening was exactly 27.15 seconds. thats insane right?!.  ^
i have a noticeable lag using the Gnome desktop after a while or after waking from sleep, gnome_shell process seems to have a problem for me..  yes, that is definitely a problem... unless you are running a P4 with 512MB of RAM... which I am guess you are not. :)
ok looks like im getting some errors. http://paste.ubuntu.com/6570482/.  any ideas on what i should do?
was just looking up Macbook Pro and 13.10
oh sry to nag
no worries, I am sure you are eager to get it going. Looks like the Ubuntu Macbook Pro community page is not updated for 13.10 yet.
:/. should i go back to 13.04. ?
If 13.04 works for it, then I would if I were you. I have not experienced enough of a difference in 13.10 to make it worth any migration trouble.
i was getting the same lag on 13.04. but i didnt test it 4 long. the goal was to go to 13.10 from the start and i thought maybe the issue would get resolved in the upgrade
ahh I see. Usually Ubuntu comes out of the gate pretty snappy feeling.
the last line of dmesg was: Warning: nss-myhostname is not installed. Changing the local hostname might make it unresolveable. Please install nss-myhostname!. should i try a sudo apt-get install nss-hostname. ?
there is no such package by that name
lol idk. im an uber noob
I guess I would be surprised if that was the culprit, anyway. Other have had that message without issues. But I do not know anything about it beyond that.
ok
no worries... you have it running on a Mac, so that is something... at least it was an accomplishment the last time I installed it on a Mac.
any ideas about this error: ERROR @wl_cfg80211_get_station : Wrong Mac address
off the cuff, I am going to guess it is a graphics driver issue.
yeah im think ur right
my off the cuff message was an overal thought, not in reference to that last message you sent.
which is weird bc my card is supported and there is a proprietary driver
How can I configure my nic cards so that Static IP address work correctly?

and nothing
!msttcorefonts. I getting an error when trying to instal MS core fonts. "Package msttcorefonts has no installation candidate" Any ideas?
you need to enable multiverse.
I have, will double check.
also, if you've added multiverse recently, rerun apt-get update.
Already done that.
Any error messages on apt-cache show msttcorefonts, ?
Whats the exact command I should be running to check?
'apt-cache show msttcorefonts' ?
It doesn't return anything after running tha command.. that
not even "Unable to locate package msttcorefonts"?
Nope, nothing..  The error I get when installing tells me the package is not available but is referenced by another package.
have you installed any packages successfully since your last /etc/apt/sources.list change?
Yup..  Maybe the package is missing from my local repo.
you could check that with ftp..  any output on 'apt-cache search nonfree' ?
Yup nonfree returns an output
what's your local repo?
Singapore. Let me get the exact server name..  sg.archive.ubuntu.com

I came acro a condition in a CMTS at work in which I got in when I shouldn't have. It's a IOS like cisco, but it's not. What happened was that I I was letting my fingers move out of habit putting in a user/pass for another machine. 3 times I got access denied as I was expecting. The forth time I got in. I had less permissions then even the non-privileged mode becuase I was not even able to do a show command. What I'm trying to und. erstand is how. Did I get with a missing uid? Basiclly I am going to bring this up to our NOC, but I want more info to tell them..  I wand to be able to explain it because I do not think I could duplicate it.
wooow mmm .... slow down a bit what's with all the lingo or abbreviations. hi.  ... what...
CMTS I am not sure it's full meaning. I think "Cable Modem" is the CM. It's an RF routed for my ISP..  err router.  RF = Radio Frequency.  IOS = Internal Operating System (Unix Based I think).  may be wrong on that one.
what's acro ... and cmts and ios noc?
Now you see why I was asking for an advanced programer or system analyst..  NOC = Network Operations Center. The group that directly deals with the routers/switches/equipment of the network.

hi, i accidently damaged /usr/lib/libGL.so.1, is there any way to fix it?
i think u have to reinstall your video driver for that.  libGL is part of your video driver
you mean like fglrx?
yea if u use ati
yep
then thats the one.  in the synaptic look in the fglrx package properties you'll pbbly see libGL file there
fglrx-kernel-2.6.26.3_8-7-2_i386.deb.  will dpkg -i do the trick?
nope u have to purge and its not fglrx-kernel package its another one.  xorg-driver-fglrx
so apt-get --reinstall install xorg-driver-fglrx? >>

I need to restart a remote computer, how can I send a message to the users x windows that the system is being rebooted, and they need to save all their work?
Maybe you could read shutdown --help.
I did, but it doesn't send a message to the users desktop that the system is being rebooted..  If the user has a console open, they will see the message, but if they don't, I want a dialog box to open up on the users desktop notifying them that they need to save work.

Has anyone done an ext4->btrfs migration on their root partition? Is it worth it, or should I just backup /home, reformat and reinstall?
.  I would do a clean install with btrfs on /.  I am not sure if the conversion will do nifty things like having / and /home on different subvolumes (which allows independent snapshotting)
Actually, I've got /home on a separate ext4 partition right now (backup would just be for double-safety). But I'll take your word that there might be other "nifty" things that the clean install would do.
it can be handy to have them on the same partition, but different subvolumes
I like having them on different partitions, just because it makes it relatively easy to switch linux distros if I want.. Even when I get a new ubuntu release, I just reformat root, mount /home in it's correct spot, and I've got a clean install.
that is fine, but no other distro uses btrfs this way, so if you really want btrfs on root then it is a non-portable solution anyway.  it is doable but there are extra streps.  I guess what I am saying is that just having / as btrfs is kind of pointless..  in that use case it is just a filesystem, though you do get per block checksumming. THe clean install makes things like apt-btrfs-snapshot work.  if this is your only real machine, I would put Ubuntu in a VM with btrfs, and then play with the btrfs features there.
What does the @home subvolume buy you over having home on a separate partition?
apt-btrfs-snapshot.  not having to partition out disk space in advance. You get all the space of the device and can dynamically change quotas
so just the ability to roll back installs?
your question is deceptively simple. btrfs has a lot going on under the hood. If you are not interested in any of the advanced features, then it doesn't matter, though I wonder why you would want to move to it.
i'm mostly interested in the copy-on-write features. I'm working quite a bit with lxc, and it seems like it's very useful for cloning containers.
the ubuntu install default is a good starting point IMHO..  I didn't think lxc and docker had stable support for btrfs yet?
lxc explicitly recommends using btrfs, I don't know about docker.

I just went through the install normally....didn't select anything but default settings
try reinstalling. that usually helps me. what burn speed did you use?. always use the lowest speed on things like this
I burnt it in 16X
was that the lowest?
I think it's just something wrong with how the dual loader is setup or something, I can't really say since I'm new at this stuff
hi, for apache2, I read ubuntu 11.04 doc, it says 'ErrorDocument' directive can be found under apache2.conf. and Alias directive direct error msg in apache2.conf. but none of them can be found under apache2.conf. the doc is totally incorrect. where can I find the ErrorDocument setup? thanks.
try /etc/apache2/conf.d/localized-error-pages ?.  not sure, my apache2 setup is far from default :)
thanks a lot for the reply. the document you mentioned does have those directives, but they are all comment out. that means they are not being used. any other places?
i think its customer per site-available perhaps.  sorry a little high here, its per site-available perhaps *.  give me a sec, jumping on my india box.
thanks a lot. i checked virtual-host config, not there. :)
ISPConfig3 (what i use to manage my webserver) seems to add ErrorDocument directives to its own file, which is located in sites-*/site.com
do you mean virtual host config files under sites-available/ ? the default setup only has default and default-ssl. they both do not have this ErrorDocument directive. I am just learning apache2. the doc is just incorrect. I am wondering how apache2 with default setup read the ErrorDocument Directive.
can anyone help me pls? I have problems installing my driver nvidia
are you following the wiki?
yes I am
RAR needs to die. We have 7z anyway.
sometimes you and I have no control over the formats we receive.  and RAR still has a competitive advantage over 7z....
those are both true. it's too bad.
guys, I updated my kernel to the latest version, however the package manager this morning is trying to install an older version of the kernel on an update.. why? and how do you stop it? I certainly don't want to downgrade
where did you get the "newer" kernel from
a deb umm
from where
yeah 1 sec.  http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.5.4-quantal/
so you've put that kernel on a 12.04 box ?
yeah
so you've put that kernel on a 12.04 box ?
works nice
why ?.  why have you done that ?
because its newer.. why not?
then you should know what you're doing if you're taking that approach
really? its not hard to just install the .deb, it just worked.. if not I would have rolled back using grub and removed it
honestly, why change a working kernel thats fully supported, meets dependencies and is part of your branch to an unreleased unpatched kernel for no reason
I don't see the issue
would it be ok to ask about libreoffice questions here ?. can anyone help me find what i am looking for ... i dont know what it is called so im having a hard time finding it...

why doesn't sudo source /etc/bash.bashrc when it runs commands?
Because 1) it isn't sudo's job, it's bash job, and 2) sudo doesn't run bash, it directly execs the command.
cheers. (and damn) so where does sudo get it's PATH from?

Hello everyone, untaring this "wkhtmltopdf-0.9.9-static-amd64.tar.bz2" and placing it in /usr/local/bin with the name wkhtmltopdf owner root:root should work right?

maybe you should try to reboot after that time fix?
not sure what "time fix" you are thinking of, but I already rebooted like 5 times to no avail ;)
"Superblock last mount time is in the future. Fix? yes" <--- from your paste.  is your date/time correct?
no, the time wasn't correct - it's correct in the installed Kubuntu but in the LiveCD it showed up as 4 hours earlier. Adjusted it now, but do you think this was the problem?.  anyway, I'll try again now
hi, if some1 can help, im trying to be able to have internet over (wlan0) and lan with sub-nets over (eth0)
are you wanting to share the interent, or just access those networks
i want to be ablle to access network btu with subnet
thats easy, you will need to configure your LAN to NOT use DHCP and just static what ever ip space it has
example wlan0 192.168.1.1 (internet) eth0 10.0.0.1 with access to 10.0.*.1..... or access to 10.*.*.*
Does this font spacing look wierd to you? http://picpaste.com/Screenshot-Inbox_for_john_geonix.com_-_Thunderbird.png
yes, a little...
Any idea what might be causing it?
I mean.. the text in the list of mails.. not the folder view or the mail content view
yes, it's not all fonts - just some. Bold ones look the worst

Anybody know how to install GNome Shell themes? I found a guide but things aren't working the way I expected.. am I stupid, or can I not report a bug on the launchpad site? It keeps saying I must do it through the OS... yet I don't have the laptop in front of me...
it would probably be easier for everyone involved if you wait until you are at the computer then use ubuntu-bug to report it.
if thats the case, if I'm trying to report a wireless bug, what would I use in the entry? I never understood that process. I always found it easier to just post, like a forum
how do i go about making firefox play videos using the VLC, or mplayer plugin, as opposed to what its using now?. does anybody know how to change firefox video plugins?

which Xorg driver are you using?
i dont know because xorg.conf nolonger contains that information
hrm. are you able to get back to X via f7 or f8?
f7.  yes by f7
ok - check your System->Administration->Hardware drivers
it says no proprietar drivers are in use on this system... other than that its blank
odd... have you tried booting without the 'quiet splash' options set?
those are set by default. i tried removing then and have the same issue
ok
actually i removed the quiet option and changed splash to nosplash
that's just fine :)
out of ideas?
still looking..
ok thanks :)
is this jaunty?
yes upgraded.... i had the same issue before i upgraded though
damnit
why not?
you cant upgrade to 1.5 with breezy
how?. nm. nm
from my understanding its not stable enough to be used in ubuntu
I'm getting an error when I put sgid and suid on an executable file, it gives me "Can't do setuid (cannot exec sperl)". What is the significance of this?
is said executable a perl script, perchance?
not sure. Let me look. Yes :/. Not gonna work?
you need package perl-suid, then.  the hardy package says something about it being deprecated, but the intrepid package doesn't, so it appears to be undeprecated

Hi. I think I can not report bug reports. Because lsb_release is crashing and it stops apport to report bugs I think. I am on Xubuntu 12.04.2 x86 32-bit
can you do lsb_release -a
I can, it gives Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS
ok, so then lsb_release is not crashing
but it keeps saying it is crashing everyday and report bugs and report bugs about apport and lsb_release and I think bugs are actually not reported
what says it's crashing ?.  what's actually happening
I just started ubuntu-bug to report it manually and .. it popped as bug report.
report what manually ?
"sorry, the application lsb_release has closed unexpectedly". using ubuntu-bug ?
so that just randomly pop's up
it starts reporting keyboard addon bug, then apport itself then after 6 or so bug reports it quits. now it popps up apport-gtk bug report
slow down
It is like that since the first day of install 
so your system is running fine, then you get a popup saying lsb_release has closed unexpectedly
ok 
is my summary correct ?
, it first pops up like application crash, then apport-gtk crash and then lsb_release crash
you're not making sense
now reports /usr/lib/command-not found
you system is running fine - then you get a warning that lsb_release has crashed, correct ?
this is my second instalaltion on second HDD. Since the moment of update from 12.04 to 12.04.2 it pops up bugs and I think apport is unable to report them automatically.
please stop giving me information I'm not asking for and answer the question I AM asking
no, system running fine, and he pops up showing many crash bug reports once a day
hey. Im working on setting up grub and trying to figure out the root line. Linux says the hard drive is hdb1. How do I change that to hd0 etc?
hd(1,0) (counting from 0 for each)
i know about that. However i have two disks and i need to figure out where my windows partition is for GRUB.
sudo fdisk -l
that returns info in hdb2.  It does not return where the NTFS partition is.
fdisk -l should list every partition on all fixed drives; one of them should be marked as ntfs or vfat on the right
i started up GParted. That says its hdb1
then it would be hd(1,0)
so i take it its (hd1,0)
erm,  :)
yeah... That's what it says in my GRUB startup. But it just displays a bunch of random characters..  The whole problem may have been that i had the ( right before the hd instead of next to the 1.
no, you wer right, that's what the erm was ;)
well shit. That means it doesn't work right.
hi I need help , my usb drive mount on read only cause i've crashed while trying to creat a backup of my files. now I need the command tu mount my usb drive manualy

Does anyone know if the NOPASSWD entries work for cronjob? I put "sirisian ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/sirisian/Desktop/ubuntu/foo.sh" into visudo as the last line. I can run foo.sh as the user sirisian and I have it echo out whoami into a log. When I put it into a cronjob it echos out my user, but all the sudo commands fail. One is just a simple sudo ln command to create a symbolic link between two absolute paths. Does the file. require special permissions?
using the NOPASSWD entry is not supported here.  but yes it should work
do you know a better channel for help on this subject?
Back in DOS you could use "dir *.ace" to show only "ace" files. How you do that on Linux?
ls *.ace
just like normal lspci, or lsusb?. ls alone will work as a dir?
no, lspci is a program to list pci devices. ls is a program to list directory contents / files (hence ls - short for list)
Wow, With colors and all! Thansk for the help dude! Take care
also look at ls -al
Will do the ls -help and check them all out
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart <cr> * Running /etc/init.d/networking restart is deprecated because it may not enable again some intervaces <cr> * Reconfiguring network interfaces...

can you open another terminal and look at dmesg

hi, i'm on a fresh install of karmic and flash randomly stops playing sound from time to time. like one minute i play a youtube video and it's fine, i go and do something else and then when i try and play another video *poof* sound's gone. this _never_ used to happen on gutsy->jaunty (all 4 releases). and yes, i was using pulseaudio on jaunty as well
sound stops only in flash?
dunno actually. don't have the problem _right now_. i shall make a note of checking that next time (any audio file from any random podcast played with the totem plugin will do, right?)
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-panel/+bug/53897 mentions the same issue I ran into.
just curious why you don't just use Gnome instead?
Because I didn't know any better at the time; I was seeking a light-weight easy-to-use distro. This system is circa 2002..  I may indeed switch the window manager to gnome at this point, though.
restricted drivers manager wants me to install something called "nvidia". I don't trust it because i finally got 3d acceleration to work and it might screw it up
if you've already got 3d acceleration you don't need to install it again from the restricted manager
slart: why does it ask for it then?
it doesn't know what drivers you are using.. you've installed the drivers manually, right?
slart: i used recovery console to install 180.22 from nvidia.com
yup.. then the restricted drivers manager doesn't know that you already have drivers that work...  just ignore it
slart: i would think that it would ask to install nvidia-glx-96, nvidia-glx-173, and nvidia-glx-177, but it just says "nvidia
its the hw makers fault for not hhaving a gpl driver avail? :)
licensing doesn't really factor into it. there are a massive amount of non-GPL drivers for Linux
but are they included by default.
how can i associate irc:// links with firefox/xchat ?
in firefox when I clicked on such a link it had some dialog about an external application and I just said yes or ok or whatever it was
i don't get that option, just a message saying there is no association with that type of link
should i run "runLime.sh"

Hi. So after booting I have to establish some connection to the internet in the first few minutes, otherwise I cant establish connections to the internet.. I found out that I get an IP assigned from the dhcp, but I cant resolv a host, so it's a DNS problem. What can be responsible for this?
the dns server you are using
it's my DSL router (fritzbox). and for all other devices its reliable
what host are you trying to resolve
doesnt matter, cant resolv a single one
what hosts are you trying to resolve
doing dig google.com @<my router ip> works
ok, so you know the router is working, how do you know yoru ubuntu box is using the router
I dont.. How do I check this?. "ip route show"?
no.  that shows routes
tracert?
no, that traces routes
:D. okay, enlighten me
are you using network manager to configure your host
no. I.. dont configured anything
right, so it's network manager configuring your network
It's just connected to an AP via ethernet
this is a desktop install right ?
the AP is connected to my router.  lubuntu + i3 without gnome
how do I fix my /etc/resolv.conf to get the right dns sever info from dhcp
you need to cehck your /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
deufral what changes do I need to make in that file so it gets the right ip from the right dns server?
and see if the 'request' section contains 'domain-name-servers'
it does have a section that contains that info but it does not specify an specific hostname nor Ip address

Hello, folks. I find ubuntu a lil slower than my previous OS - Windows XP, how come?. Guys, why my ubuntu is slower than windows xp, anyone?. Even when opening documents or e.g. terminal it shows me an hourglass, winxp is much faster, is there anything I can do about it?
How much ram do you have
2GB.  maybe I have to uninstall KDE and use xfce?.  Gnome was the same
How do I uninstall gnome?. (Not the packages it has with it. )
what specfically about gnome? cause you could just install another DE/WM and use that if hdd space is not a issue

trying to use the hoary-live cd as a source for a dist-upgrade, anyone have experience with this?
typically live cds are not useful for installs.  i don't believe you'll find any "repository-like" things on there, no .debs, just unpacked files
hoary is supposed to be pretty much the same on the live. oh ok. that makes sense
livecds are pretty tight on available space
gotcha, thanks

I had tried to figure out what to do with that..
does anyone know of any incompatibilities between dash and bash that would break things if I fixed the default shell. ?. sorry, not fixed, switched it to bash
there are quite a few differences.. some scripts just won't run with one or the other
ah, so I couldn't just hand things over to bash after x starts to ensure things work for users?
I'm not sure if bash can do everything dash does.. any special reason you want to replace dash?
my thinking was that if they were nicely compatible, then the only negative upshot would be an impreceptible speed difference if they restarted stuff, etc
dash is used just because it's a lot lighter than bash.. so replacing dash with bash will probably slow your computer down
yes, I was rather hoping I could hand over to bash after init had started the machines. and it's more than one machine
but why not give it a try.. rename dash and create a shortcut that's called dash but pointing to bash.  then try rebooting.. but have a live cd ready if things don't work out
I'm completely happy to have it used during startup since that offers an advantage. but the incompatibility with shell scripts doesn't really give users any advantage
or even better.. try it in a vm
aside from the pleasure of being admonished for expecting things to work as bash - and I don't feel committed to arguing with them about that :)
will array kernel make my msi laptop better?
the array kernel is not a Ubuntu product

Hi. I need to help, I want to make a script that will change directory to /home//docs/ROMs/Game\ Boy and run a command from Terminal. Help?. And to any WINtard that says "Run deltree C:\" I'M ON FREAKING UBUNTU. mmm... cola to calm myself from the WINtards...
calm down dude.  your complaints are better suited for #ubuntu-offtopic
What I want to do is make a script to execute an emulator from the Terminal
Why does Ubuntu insist that I close any application that might be using sound? If I listen to youtube video in Firefox, then Last.fm player get's the 'Alsa sound system is either busy or not there'. Or if I was listening to Last.fm player and I want to watch a video in VLC then I have to make sure all firefox windows are closed and so is Last.fm. Why is that???
configure Lst.fm player to use pulseaudio or sed if possible
why does alsa break like that though?.  and since alsa breaks, why is it set to be the standard?
please can somebody help me? my system no longer see's my wireless adapter, i've tried removing NM and installing WICD but this too refuses
reboot into an earlier kernel and see if the wifi comes back
thor: i have no idea how to do this lol, i'm new to linux
when you reboot you will see a 3 second countdown. Press ESC during that 3 seconds and you will get a menu of the installed kernels. I suspect you are using the highest number (2.6.28-15) which has just recently come out. See if you have 2.6.28-13, and if so boot into that. Any number lower than -15 (or whatever you are using) is worth a try
this makes a lot of sense, i did a system upgrade earlier and that's when the wireless stopped
I have an Asus laptop with Ubuntu 14.04 installed on it. The laptop has an Nvidia Geforce 750 and I'm using nvidia-331 driver. My problem is that the monitor doesn't detect any resolution and, probably as a consequence, the text displayed is not sharped and the colours are... strange. red is too red, green is too green and bright. is it a driver problem, an OS problem or a hardware problem?
sure its not that Optimus nonesense?

anybody have pidgin running with video chat on google talk?. on lucid, i have gstreamer ffmpeg plugin, etc.

Did something happen to SSH with the recent updates?
probably you mean the openssl bug fix.  there was a HUGE bug in openssl that got closed, so you have to regenerate all your ssh keys now

How can I debug why "/sbin/mdadm --examine --scan --config=partitions" hangs on my system?
strace and dmesg
dmesg says nothing at all and if I connect to the process with "strace -p <pid>", I get "strace: Process 14411 attached" and then strace also hangs forever
strace /sbin/mdadm --examine --scan --config=partitions
is it safe to run another one while the first is hung?
when creating multiple partitions should they be all primary?
no.
@ should i only have one primary partition and the rest logical?

Hi. Why is there no network-manager service in ubuntu ?
network manager is installed by default on ubuntu
Ye, but I don't find its service in service --status-all. There's a 'networking' services, but I suppose 'networking' is not network-manager,but interfaces
sudo service network-manager start
'unrecognized service'.  There's also no init script for network-manager in /etc/init.d on my system. pretty weird :S
maybe it needs installation
Do you find network-manager on ur system in init.d?
yes
Hmm. That's weird. Also. Network-manager starts on boot but if there is no init script how does it that?
is this a new clean install or an upgrade via the internet?
I installed the system 1 year ago
and suddenly NM doesn't load?
It works. But I want to stop its service. And I can't stop it, because there is no nm service
why, do you want to go static from network /interfaces?
Because I want to use bridging. it looks like nm is started as a system service in dbus. /usr/share/dbus-1/sytem-service/org.freede....dispatcher.servic

did you do the first two steps?.  mkdir mnt
yes already on tutorial
alright are their files in extract-cd directory now?
yes
okay well that tutorial is old. There probably isn't a mnt/casper/filesystem.squashfs You'd ahve to look in mnt/casper and see what the name of the sqaush file is.

hi guys. i'm having trouble getting usb with ubuntu to boot. using windwos 8. running msi ge40. secure boot is turned off. can anyone help me?
That'll be UEFI ... have you disabled quick-boot ?
that's the option from contorl right?.  i'll check
in most UEFI set-ups, its a boot option
i've turned off fast startup. but i'm not sure about quick boot.  should I enter the BIOS?
Good... that's the same thing just different names I think..  when the system starts, are you pressing the system's alternate boot menu key, so you can choose which device to boot?
f11 yes. but none of them show the sandisk usb as an option. i've also done what was recommended by a few forums. and changing the boot priorities. the three types of usb (cd, hdd, or key). none of them seem to trigger
OK, for the USB, you might see two entries, one will begin something like "EFI: ... USB ..." the other maybe "ATA: ... USB...." ... you're choosing the "EFI:" entry?
the usb.  i'll be right back
I use screen, often with half a dozen apps in it. want to seriously geek your terminal? run splitvt inside of multiple screens. splitvt + screen FTW
splitvt?? what's that?
splitvt splits any terminal into upper and lower terminals.  splitvt is like quadkonsole but without the need for <puke> KDE
So it's kinda like your version of screen?
well, for example if I have multiple things I want to be seeing at once without toggling screen for, I can load them up in stacked areas of a terminal
how about a screenshot?
hmm, I don't have one handy.  its just a boring image of two terminals in one anyway
ever used Clive to download videos?. "dban" ??. oh!!!

hey all -- I'm trying to make my multimedia keys work in XFCE -- I've created .Xmodmap -- added it to .xsession and it doesn't work :/
try setxkbmap
Just tun it?
add in keysyms, basically
It seems that when I try and bind the keys in XFCE, they are all being read as the same key...
you sure you have the right Keysyms?. I'm not sure how you bind keys in XFce, actually, I was talking about a global X bind
xev to find them and direct copy and paste from /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB
Dreadshoot: yeah, that's global X, i'm pretty sure. errr. damned tab-complete!.  sorry
so it seems that .xsession isn't being called at startup ?!? odd -- I manually ran the xmodmap command using my Xmodmap file and they work now

I'm installing Wine in software center, but it seems to be stuck at a certain point in "applying changes," what should I do?
wine pulls in a lot of dependancies, give it some time. it might also popped up a windows for accepting some eula
already popped that window, I accepted.  and it's been stuck for a good 20 minutes
Can it manage more than one core at a time
the kernel? yes
Yea,
get an SMP kernel which should be default in edgy and feisty i believe
I found a couple..I wanted to try to compile an SMP..HAving trouble with the headers
Hello. I had VirtualBox working just fine.. after a kernel upgrade it broke. Is there anything to be done to fix virtualbox

I can't get pulse to run as a daemon...if I run it as pulseaudio -vv it runs fine but if I do sudo /etc/init.d/pulseaudio start nothing happens (no error, but nothing can connect to the pulse server)
have you checked your logs for any error messages?
dmesg has nothing related to it.  Where else?
try out /var/log/messages, that's normally a good place to start. Otherwise, check the other logs in /var/log/
Nothing.  No pulse related entries
have you read the pulse init.d script to see if there's anything in there you're meant to be setting up?
I don't see anything, but I'm not the most informed shell scripter. Do you have hardy?
as it happens, I do..  but I'm running server; it's pulseaudio, you say?
Aye.  It's odd, I get no errors, but it just doesn't start. It's not in my running process list, and nothing can connect to it
pretty common for a misconfigured daemon. It takes time to get used to them..  have you tried pulseaudio -D ?
It's running now, but still not accepting connections
That's all the init.d script calls; read the options from man pulseaudio and also read the script again in start-stop-daemon line in pulseaudio to see how the maintainers are using it.
Hrm, nevermind it was just that app
hm something is worng with 8.10 programms like music-player and nvidia-settings are crashing
possibally :) check in #ubuntu+2.  possibally :) check in #ubuntu+1 oops. :)
im still dist-upgrading. maybe it is fixed after that.
so there is no posibility with totem then -.-. i hoped that this would be in development os sth like that. download and play the downloaded file should be part of the youtube plugin. like in mozilla-mplayer
get the package youtube-dl from the repos
i dont want no fu command line utility...
what was that?
i want a gui tool that shows youtube stuff but without streamung directly
I mean what is fu command line
like quicktime player or mplayer-plugin or the youtube flash player. damn command line
jazzka: I like Monospace 10.
hmm, i didn't see the option, but perhaps
that is where it is typically.
if they weren't, where would i configure gdm to recognize them?
IIIEars: busy channel..  they are there.
Yeah, anything on that page could get pushed though. They have a lot on there for only six months.
welcome to rapid developmen. t. most of it will likely happen
That would rock.

hello, if anyone here is running ubuntu on a macbook with a os x partition, would it be possible to us your isight firmware to make my isight work in ubuntu.. i don't have an os x partition
look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MacBookPro in section isight, and follow the instruction.  the firmware is included in the tgz
i was under the impression that that was an automatic firmware loader, and that it automatically got the firmware from the os x partition
I am afraid not, isight works perfectly under ubunty 7.10, follow the instructions and you will have it
alright, thanks for the advice though I have done this tutorial before without success but i will try again

anyone else having the "no mountable file systems" problem with ISOs on the mac? e.g. http://releases.ubuntu.com/raring/ubuntu-13.04-desktop-amd64+mac.iso
where are you trying to mount it?
- anywhere. disk utility, finder.  - https://www.google.com/search?q=%22no+mountable+file+systems%22+iso+ubuntu+mac
disk utility?. archive manager in ubuntu will mount it.  a google search means nopthing you need to detail what you want and the final goal here.
- that's nice, but i am trying to install ubuntu
HOw?
- by downloading an iso, burning or mounting it, and running the installer
I'm still having problems with my partitions :(. Gparted still can't see any partitions. If i run gparted from terminal, i get some errors in terminal after it starts up:. unable to open /dev/fd0 read-write (read only file system). Input/output error during read on /dev/fd0. Can't have overlapping partitions
What errors.. and is this off livecd of ubuntu or gparted live or installed os
it's on the installed os
floppy drive 0
no floppy. is that what it's complaining about there?
What errors.. and is this off livecd of ubuntu or gparted live or installed os.  yes fd0 floppy drive 0
unable to open /dev/fd0 read-write (read only file system). Input/output error during read on /dev/fd0. Can't have overlapping partitions. I am running gparted from installed os.. ok, and what about the "can't have overlapping partitions". i think that sounds... well, bad.

that directory doesn't seem to be there.
grep -i documentroot /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default. DocumentRoot /var/www

you have a /etc/apache2 directory?
no

Dose any one know if ubuntu would ever have some thing like restore or even better timemachine in mac osx ?
not by default, so if you haven't set up a backup and lost something, you'll have to use other methods to find it
not lost just hate reinstalling when things go major wrong.. loose every setting
what is D?
where should I find the .deb's file on the cd?! the pool/main and pool/restricted only contains 29 basic packages
pool would be where they reside, you may have the livecd which has less debs on it
i dowloaded the ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso
yes, "desktop" is the livecd (as opposed to alternate, which i prefer)
no one told me this before! ;).  so desktop is the livecd and alternate is the desktop cd or what?!
look on the cd download page of your favorite mirror for descriptions of "desktop" "alternate" and "server" isos.  "desktop" is basically filled up with all that live stuff, so no room for many debs really. alternate has the power :)

no prob there versions are automatically checked; fret not u wasted little or no space plus this cache can be later cleaned if u wish; versions of package are mantained online by the ubuntu package server.  if u already have a package apt-get doesn't download it again unless there is a newer version
it wasnt in the pkg manager add remove or synaptic .. i ran the command given for ubuntu destro by wine [ was downloading wine]

brilliant :-) ... now type 'w'
--http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19590 , is this good?
this is the usual reminder... so you just got rid of the old mess :-)... Good for a new start :-)
- awesome. when i re-install, should i put in noapix acpi=off? as that's what started me in this mess.  -- not putting those in, i mean.
acpi=off wasn't probably a clever idea... but reboot now and boot again with the CD to verify taht everything went alright
-- why not? it told me to boot again with it like that, which i did, and it was fine, i just had little space.
this little extra time won't hurt... be safe
does any know of a good video conferencing app??
for linux, ekiga.  (was gnomemeeting)
does it have support for web cams?
yes. it works with mine, at least
sweet, any speacil one that works out of box?
i'd just switch to xubuntu.
well, that's a little intense
;). honestly something's wrong if you're worried about the colours of icons
that's so invalids, there's a reason designers care about things like that in all software
although when you say they're black and white, that suggests there is something wrong.  yeah designers, but not users.
we;; I care, I'm a user. well*
them only occasionally having colour does sound a bit like a graphical problem
I can assure you I'm not having any graphical issues.
then how come you have that affect when it's not the norm?
could someone please direct me to a channel for computer building and compatibility with Linux
try ##hardware, although am not sure if that's it
ok,, thanks

Does anyone know how to get firefox downloaded ?. when you can't access
Um, through the software centre or as a .deb?
terminal 'apt-get install firefox' won't work and the ubuntu software center tells me to use the main source and then nothing changes.
how did it get Unisnatlled?
I was using it, and it wouldn't load any webpages for a few hours and i was on xbox playing online with a 4 bar and on an irc channel and there seemed to be no problem, but it wouldn't work so i removed it.
if there is any it's likely something like 256. ary you trying to build a custom SSD out of memory xics? :D. stics. well, you know what i mean

BTW envy installs the proprietary nvidia binary drivers, which is why it's not shipped by default - there are some open nvidia drivers that come with ubuntu but they're not as good(tm)
there is an official way of installing said binary drivers too. Restricted Drivers Manager
yeh but good luck with that :p. nvidia-settings is the best screen/xorg setup has ever been - i'm so happy with it

Ok, I'm trying to execute a command over SSH. dpkg --reconfigure -a. Now, when that is run over ssh, there is a yes-no prompt. How can I run a command over ssh and answer a prompt like that. I'm using ssh ip_address 'command'
-t i think?.  or just log in and run the command after.  ssh -t should do it
I've got over 60 computers I execute commands on at once
cssh is your friend :p
can you help me with and example
but -t should let you type on those commands, or just use -phigh to force dpkg to default them
you rock.  phigh it is
look at cluster-ssh in the repository too
I've heard of that.  I have passwordless authentication on all my machines.  then I wrote a script that goes out and contacts each machine sequentially
cssh is just a wrapper around ssh, so ud_rsa/dsa will still work.  parallelize that stuff :p
why parallelize?.  thanks for the advice btw
sequential must take forever.  np
I suffix all my commands with the & symbol
MM2: in breezy the Print key takes a screenshot (see System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts)
thanks a bunch, I don't know how much I can thank you. its just really nice when you just installed a distibution and you get so much help.
you're welcome :)
i wonder if there is a way to send beer through telnet for you =)

looks like it extracted but where did it go? i dont see it in my desktop
look in your home folder
not there.  found it.  thanks
do you have unrar-free installed?
already managed to extract
I'm not sure but I think unrar can conflict with unrar-free if you're using Karchiver or file-roller
yes i have karchiver.  should i uninstall it?
sorry, so how do i stop subversion, unless it is svnserve i really need to stop :s
fezK: kill it. fezK: as I said kill -9 name. fezK: But you need to find the id of the process. Which you find with ps -aux. a 8 digit 'I think' number
bash: kill: subversion: arguments must be process or job IDs (when i use kill -9 subversion)

hi! Question: how can I make it so that a certain USB drive always shows up in /dev/ with the same name?. I've done it before, but I can't remember how...
edit the partitions label.. there are different tools for different file system types.  easiest is probably to edit the label using gparted.  NOTE!!.. there are two labels.. editing the wrong one will erase everything on the drive
so that name determines where it shows up in /dev?
if you want to use a command line I think it's "mtools" for editing ntfs/fat labels...  yes
Huh. That doesn't sound familiar for some reason.
With a static IP, wireless works fine. but if i switch to ethernet, i can only get network with a static ip - no internet. with automatic config it works fine. Why is that?
-> do this, compare your route table when it is working, and when it is not working, you should see the clue
route table is empty in both methods

ohh, no idea
Well, Hmm 
actually no, you need wine
Damn, wine seems to no be working now. I've even been to the wineHQ and they have no clue wtf the problem is.

1.1.0 Just updated last night when wineHQ told me too.
how can i copy multiple files with one statement ?. as in cp file1 file2. what if I have 3 files to copy. anyone ?
cp file1 file2 ... file_n destination
no commas in between ?
no.  that's what "cp * /to/here" expands to.  "cp <list of files separated by spaces> /to/here" :)
when I copied my files to the new directory, the new directory shows those files with a lock on them ?
how do i remove i8042 loading during boot ?
add the boot option i8042.blacklist=1
grub_cmdline_linux_default ?
or run: echo "blacklist i8042" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf > /dev/null.  whichever line has "quiet splash".  add it in the quotes to make "quiet splash i8024.blacklist=1"
k. here we go
remember to run: sudo update-grub to apply
Nope, still present:. [ 2.691481] i8042: PNP: No PS/2 controller found. Probing ports directly.
using gnome classic in ubuntu 12.04. when I right click apps on my desktop panels (eg: weather) it only shows me "About". I used to get many options on 10.04. How do I get these options?
sach: gnome "classic" is fallback mode. and not fully functional... it keeps getting worse and will be dropped completely shortly :(
yes, I know...
sach: what are you trying to do specifically?
trying to tweak my desktop panels. eg: add my dictionary app, system monitor graph, etc.
guys, some newbie help please... I'm finding 1) that I can't save files on a drive partition and 2) that I can't edit and save an existing file in /etc/. something to do with root permissions? why does the sole user account i have not have sufficient permissions for this stuff?. "you are not the owner so you cannot change these permissions"
you need sudo in front of the command..  it is a security/safety feature.
but i'm running from CLI, i'm in the GUI
yes, it works the same way. you are not actually root, but you can become root. for individual commands, just put 'sudo' in front. if you want to be root for a while, do 'sudo -i' to get a root shell..  you'll find that when you 1st enter a sudo command, it asks for your password, but it does keep you authorized for a time, so it's not too cumbersome.
so i can just type sudo to gain root for the whole of the current logged-in session?
Ok, so anyone know what package the apache related bin file 'apu-config' is in?. The module wants that too
did you install the apache2-dev package yet?
yep. Thats the first thing I did
hello i have a question. if i make changes to the system in gconf-editor does it only affect my username or the whole system in general. for example if i tweak the sys so it doesn't display mounted images on the desktop, will this happen to other users, or just me?
that is user specific.  rule of thumb: if you don't have to put in your password, it affects only you
- yeah i thought so. is there any way to sudo it?
how can fix this Error http://pastebin.com/m5d9d9649 ?????????????
export WINK_INSTALL_DIR
nothing happen!!

Hey ubuntu guys, is there a way to enable true wireless routing (wlan0 to wlan0) or split wlan0 into multiple virtual interfaces? I need to do some routing and I don't have wired access.
sure you can create subinterfaces like in cisco routers
sweet, is there any documentation for that? I haven't programmed a cisco in like 5 years.

hi all, quick question. I have linux box setup and working on the local lan. got samba installed. I share a folder to my friends that runs windows. they can see the share. but when they try and access it, it asks them for a password
you are sharing through samba?
yes
i have had this problem, the way i fixed was that i created an account and shared the password
thanks. will try
i had a config fiel (smb.conf) that did the trick, the minimal config file doesn't work (i.e. typing the share, writeable guest = ok and public)
_i "guest = ok" where do I put this in smb.conf
how do I set up a dual boot on an EeePC?

Mine's Hard Drive, is dev/sda2 vital in anyway?
Does anyone know how to reformat a FAT32 partition to an HFS+ partition in parted?
I don't think gparted can mark a hfs file system
Gah.
you just want a blank partition for macos to put a file syssm on
yes. But the mac OS disk utils won't format things right for some reason
yup, I undersstand that
so how would I go about that? Do you know? :O
I don't know why mac OS isn't writing to the partition.  you may want to ask ##apple or ##macos how to debug mac os.  what model mac is this ?
me neither, it's not coming up. Thanks.  it isn't a mac. :-P
then don't ask it's illegal to run mac os on non-apple hardware
I'm asking how to format an hfs+ partition, nothing more.
hi guys, i have a strange question. I am trying to make a webserver that will call a program and capture its standard output in a file using the redirect operator ">". I am creating multiple threads after receiving each request on webserver. But i am confusd about onething that will multiple threads output will be written to the same file when is use the redirect operator? OR each thread will be able to create its own output file??
if it's redirecting to the same path then they will rewrite it.  you'd have to use >> to append
no each thread will redirect output with a new filename.
also look into if you can use a mutex lock in the web server's programming langauge
isn't mutex needed when we are writing to the same file?
yeah if you're using a different filename that's fine
ah ok, thank you so much. :)

My MSI wind u160 won't boot from my pendrive. ubuntu 10.10. I even did F11 to choose it..... But it just stood still on a linuxboot screen thing
did you check the iso you downloaded to make sure it was good?
where do I get an md5 for the one from http://ubuntu.com/?
should be right there from where you downloaded it, let me get it for you..  here you go: http://releases.ubuntu.com/maverick/ scroll down and you will see the md5sums. seems like those md5sums would be a little easier to get at.
shadow98: Md5 matches up.  Md5 matches up.  I did "try another linux build" in the usbdrive builder thing... Would that cause a problem?. it installed fine it looks like

here pops up a question. where to put grub on? and regular antswers like: mbr, /, etc...
Hello ! I try to install Gusty on a SMP computer (Tyan board). When booting the LiveCD I got dumped to initramfs. This machine was running Centos 4.6 okay. Can someone help me ?
you might try the alternate cd then; what video card
Hello, I did try 2 video card : one nvidia and one ATI.
best bet would be the alternate cd; that works when the livecd chokes
k, I will try. How I can disable the splash screen ? I want to see errors
the boot parameter nosplash and remove quiet
Okay, thanks..  I boot the livecd, press escape and ask for "live nospalsh" and I still get the splash screen at the boot time.
Hi. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, and a pretty default install of that. I used CompizConfig to configure it so that when I move the mouse to the bottom left corner, all the currently windows are exposed so I can pick one of them. This works, but when I log out and back in, it doesn't work anymore. When I check, the setting is still there, but it's being ignored. Any way to fix this?
I also found the same problem on my Ubuntu 12.04 box. To get it working, I have to start CCSM, uncheck the settings related to screen corners & then re-enable them. However, some reboots it works fine & sometimes you have to go back to CCSM...
Yeah I know about that workaround. I don't want to set the setting each time. No fix?

hello, I've got one of tool windows flown away from desktop. what shall I do to bring window back without closing it? I have no popup for that window on taskbar and ALT+TAB dialog does not see it.
Agent_Al: I am still looking, what windows are you talking about?
- typical tool window for config settings manager in Ubuntu 8.10, I set friction for vobble window style to extremely low value and as a result I got that window away from screen, but it was still open. I was wondering, if there's a chance to get a particular window centered on desktop?
Agent_Al: That is a Compiz or screenlets thing?
- I guess it is Compiz config window
Agent_Al: For most of those affects there is an icon on the taskbar , that lets you configure it, if the icon is gone, then either check to see if it is running...if not , restart the widget
- oh I see, thanks

anyone here got dvd shrink to work in ubuntu. anyone have any luck getting dvd shrink functional in linux. anyone have any issues getting dvd shrink to work in linux, like lets say some ASPI error
hi 
hey what is up Mike
taking care of my wife. She's home sick today.
lucky you
uh, I guess
I would really like to be able to compress the dvd so I can copy the thing, any ideas.  I think I asked you before,didnt I
yeah, is it a data DVD, or a movie?
movie.  uncompressed, 8.5 gig
and you looked at transcode?
not sure exactly how to use it.  you?
I've not used it, really
I tried dvd shrink again, ,keep getting the ASPI error
look into dvdrip
yeah, but it doesnt make the movies copyable to anothre dvd I think
it should...it uses transcode
that is the one that makes it into an .avi right
transcode can convert into several formats
I think that is the one for me, that would not let me compress on the fly
Yep. I'm on there right now
wow thats awesome.  i havent been on dalnet since 2004. if that late

1080p. 70hz
what is 1080p in pixels
1920x1080 I belive
This problem is really busting my chops now and I would greatly appreciate any input someone can offer.
That's because they're not "startup programs".  They are _sessons_.. *sessions*
Nice trying to be cute, but check it out System > Preferences > Sessions > Startup Programs. And then......?
There's a few differences in terminology between the old timers who use linux and the new timers. I've actually never used that menu there!

I want like a small panel where if I click a button, it'll type some text into the current window. How can I get that done?
You have any example of this?
just the old ubuntu panels, you could put custom xautomation launchers

kind of, I want like a floating panel in unity. kind of like a toolbar where if I click a button, it'll type stuff for me

Hi!. Anybody here knows how Nouveau works for a 8800 GT card nowadays?

hello so how do I open ports for port forwarding?
port forwarding from .. your router to your pc? or your pc to another networked device?
router to pc. but I am still getting a nat error
well .. for port forwarding, you'll have to give your box a static IP
oh yeah huh
How can I open a program through SSH? I need it to show up on the remote desktop. For example, I can tunnel to my remote PC through my phone, and I want to open a picture on the desktop
Well, that depends... you want it to open up on the main X display? There's some security in place to make that difficult.
ramirand: Yes, that's right.
Just so I know I have this straight, you're dialed in from somewhere else on computer A, and you connect in to computer B, and you want to run something on computer B that will display on computer B?
Correct again.
Is there a user logged in to computer B?
I can log in. I'm the administrator
That is, someone logged in to the X display.
I can also log in as the current user.  Yes
So there's an X display up and running, with a user logged in. OK. Do you know what the X display's ID is?
I'm guessing it's :0 ?
It's probably something like :0.  OK. If it is, then run something in the remote session, and add -display :0 to it.
All right, that's it?
I'm guessing that will give you an error, since security is probably turned on..  But it's worth a try before attempting to figure out anything more difficult! :)
I'll try it out in a second. I have to wait until the current user is ready
As an alternative, in the ssh you can type "export DISPLAY=:0".  Then all X programs will use that display by default, w/o specifying -display :0
Works PERFECTLY. Thanks!

anyone? any ideas about solving this dns issue? I feel blind without being able to google on my own in order to find a solution... switching the cable back and forth to the XP is killing me... (done it two days ago for hours)
open up a terminal and try this. nslookup google.com # do you get an answer?
tried that already... no reply.. "connection timed out; no servers could be reached"
cat /etc/resolv.conf # what do you have in there?
two lines, nameserver x.x.x.x and another one similar (with real ips)
ok, what are those ip addresses?
these are the same ips that I have in the network manager. I think that these are the ips of the DNS of my ISP, since I see the same numbers in the windows box (that works)
What's up with this new non-free flash plugin?. Is it a fixed-up 7? Or is it just a better package?

Hello how can i change my Icons by others?
Go to System-Preferences-Appearance, and then customize.  You can choose the icon scheme you want there
But if i want to add icons who i downloaded?
If you want to use a custom set of icons, you need to copy them via console (you need permissions) to /usr/share/icons.  Then they'll show up in the list at "Customize" where you went before
Example I have my icons unpacked on my desktop i need to move to that librrary i need to put in the console sudo cp /home//Desktop/Icons to /usr/share/icons?
That's right.  Once they're copied properly to /usr/share/icons, go back to where i first told you (close and open if you didn't close it) and you'll have the option to choose your custom icons
Tnx :D

Could I harm the files on my NTFS Windows XP Pro SP2 HD by running the commands "sudo fdisk -l" and "sudo mount /dev/sdXX /mnt" to mount it on my XUbuntu Live CD?
probably not, and you should be able to access the NTFS partition anyway, as long as Windows shut it down properly
Strangely I cannot access it from the LiveCD. It was properly shut down before as far as I remember. I'll try those commands, thanks! :D
wait no.  can you get into it from computer or whatever you got on Xubuntu?.  or /media or /mnt ?
I checked in /mnt and /media, they're both empty..  So don't use those commands?

Hi.. Just installed mysql-server on my box running Ubuntu Server 12.04.. However, it didn't prompt like for a root password, or offer any prompt during the setup.. On any other box, it's asked for those things.. Same when I set up phpmyadmin, no prompts.. Without these, I can't set the respective programs up properly.. Is there a package I'm missing or something?

the more core issue is it not showing a prompt when I set up a package requiring configuraiton. How can I enable the prompts again?
I'm looking
thanks. If it helps, it's a brand new box from leasweb with Ubuntu Server 12.04.3.
What was the *exact* command you entered to install?
apt-get install mysql-server
Try running (no quotes) "export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=text" then remove & reinstall mysql-server....let me know if that prompts you
doing so.

Is there anyway to lock down the screen edges so you cannot drag a window off the screen?
you mean, so you can't drag a window to another desktop?
yes but i only have one monitor
but more than one virtual desktop. You're using compiz?
ahh thats true.  2 virtual desktops, yes i am using compiz
you have compiz configuration setting manager installed?
yes
what plugin do you use to switch the desktop? Desktop wall? Cube?.  if you're using Desktop wall (on by default), turn of "Edge flip move"
oops. i thought i had compiz installed, but i removed it, i was thinking of the nvidia driver
hey, i want to backup my hdd but i can't just make a tarball of it because my external drive is fat32 and so can't handle files > 4gig. If I just copy all the files, would there be any problems with permissions when copying them back to a clean partition?. i'm talking about the *whole* root partition.
if you tar.gz your files, no. if you directly copy them, yes
how would I backup then?

why are you building additional modules ?
I need to install this: The LinuxTV project DVB code, with my version of mt352.c installed in place of the distributed version. This snapshot from CVS should build out of the box (and includes my mt352.c);
I am using some virtual hosting which gave me two hard disks sdb and sdc . Can I combine them and use them ?
yes using LVM or software RAID
so I can make RAID work on a VM ?
yeah software RAID.. but you should probably just use LVM as you can shrink/exapand partitions
LVM sounds better , still the same question can I use it on VM ?
it only works on x86. (generally)

hey is it possible to see which packager packed a zip package ?
No, usually you can just determine the format, not the program that packaged it.
ok interesting.  im in a hex editor right no, how would i determine the format?
Look at the file extension? :D
in case there is none?
MIME type.
mime type? =/
Usually you can see the MIME type of a file in Gnome by rightclicking the file and then selecting "properties"
i just use the hex editor tho. where would i see it there 
On the first tab, where it says type.
no inside the hex editor!

Having DNS problems: When applications (Firefox, IRC client, etc) run DNS queries, there's a delay of about 20 seconds before they go through. But when I use "nslookup" from the shell, it's instantaneous. Why?
did you double check that all of the servers are correct?
Yes, the servers are correct (as entered in System -> Admin -> Networking)
*shrug* I've seen similar things when the secondary or tertiary nameservers are wrong
Hmm, I'll try removing the secondary one, maybe it's wrong
did you try pinging them?
Pinging works fine (on the first one, removed the second one now). Aha. Removing the secondary DNS server seems to have solved it. It must be wrong then. Thanks for the help!
hell. hello even :). is there a way to tell unity/gnome WM I want to switch workspaces from within an application?. via dbus or somesuch
From within an application? There are keybindings (like ctrl + alt + left arrow) that work regardless of what app has focus.
not with fullscreen X apps like SDL/fullscreen
SDL ?
Simple Directmedia Layer (sort of DirectX/without 3d of Linux) used by most games etc.
a-ha I don't think so then :(.  Perhaps it's changing and you can't see the change.
the problem is that SDL "fullscreen" is true fullscreen via X request, not just a "fake maximize" and so the WM is completely "off the hook"
:(
I wanted to at least fake default keybindings (perhaps find out current ones) and tell the WM manually
hiya, how do I remove all traces of a program that I compiled myself?
did you install it, or just make?
make and install
read the readme. it should have a make uninstall or make remove or equivalent
alright thanks. pidgin :)
you can install pidgin from the repositories.  sudo apt-get install pidgin
yeah, i thought i decided to be smart and downloaded the latest version from their site. hmm
rm: cannot remove `.mediaartlocal': No such file or directory. but i am looking at it, its there
do not type the folder name, use TAB completion instead, at least for the last character. It will help you never to enter a file name, that doesnt exist. Does ls -a show the folder?
its nested a few deep from the folder i'm starting in, does that matter?
of course. Lets assume, your folder is in ~/some/where/.hiddenfolder and you open the terminal (you start in your home, "~" or /home/yourname/), then you have to rm -r ./some/where/.hidden*
then how do i start in a directory and delete every instance of a target directory under, no matter how deep?
that would be "find"
in this case it's audio/music/3ef/.mediaartlocal thats one of maybe 200.  do youy know of a way to make search show hidden files?
i am not good with find, i can only offer the command to chmod every file, hidden included, recursively. (chmod doesnt recurse hidden files): find . -type f -exec chmod 0755 {} \; consult the man page: man find
oky thanks :)
i'll have a look to the man page myself. Try to understand it meanwhile, too ;-)
i did it with search
cool
places>search for files> there is a hidden file's checkbox type deal.  thanks much for your help :)
I'm able to connect onto my Openvpn network using command "sudo openvpn --config client.ovpn", even a new network interface is showing up when I type in "sudo ifconfig" command. But my internet traffic is not being routed through my VPN instead Ubuntu is using my default internet connection?
thats configurable
How? Can you please elaborate, thanks for replying
well it depends on your needs.  as you describe it seems the server is configured to hand out routing via vpn
Yes
can you influence the openvpn server?
No, its an corporate server.  I've no control over it

thanks man! ... do you how to update it? as I have just set UTC=no, and it is currently still pointing on UTC
restart your computer and set the time properly in the BIOS.  you can set it through hwclock, but it's horribly confusing
:) ok ... i can't set the time in BIOS, because it's a remote server
oh, fun. see "man hwclock", then, it has the relevant commands

For lots of applications I get: error while loading shared libraries: liblzma.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. Ubuntu has no /usr/lib which seems to confuse the linker.. What's the idea behind that?
@ for liblzma.so.2, you probably just have to install the liblzma2 package. as for /usr/lib/, Ubuntu certainly does have it ...does your Ubuntu system not have /usr/lib ?. (that would be bad...)
and how do I get it?.  apt-get install liblzma2 => not found
@ what Ubuntu release are you running?
ah, right, it does have it..  I mean /usr/lib.  still no lzma.  is it in multi-verse or whatever it is that Ubuntu calls it?. ,liblzma2

What's the minimum recommended /boot size for 12.10? I can't find a mandatory answer anywhere... and recommendations range from 60 to 250mb..... I plan to use LVM+LUKS, if that's relevant
I use 100MiB, but that's overkill for what I need.
ok, so 100mb should be future-proof?
Unless you need more than 5 kernels at a time, it'll be fine.
ok, thx. oh, another question: does the choice between ext2/3/4 matter for /boot?. with regard to robustness, mostly

kk.  its running

like ubuntu 9 version of it.  I had to do that when i upgraded my laptop, you're left with weaker wifi but that's better than no wifi

is anyone else using a dell xps laptop with ubuntu?
What problem are you having?
I occasionally have overheating problems, and from what I've googled it looks like a design flaw in the heat sink... I didn't know if running ubuntu helped/harmed that problem at all
You can add sensors to Ubuntu (and windows I'm sure) and see which runs hotter.
I can just get these from software center right?
Well the software sensors are kind of tricky to install. I am looking up right now to do it to remind myself..  Would you like to do it together? I think I have remembered what to do.
that'd be great
First thing. install lm-sensors package
'sudo apt-get install lm-sensors' works fine?
yeah
ok done

perhaps, but packages shouldn't be broken, eol or not. manually installed the dependency and it's happy though

anyway, can anyone help me with my gfx card? I've been googling about this issue for days now, asking here and in ##linux; and no help :(
You have to tell us about the actuall issue before.
right. my issue is that every video on my system are played in slow motion. lspci -k doesn't list any drivers under gfx card, nor does lshw -c display. i915 is lited on livecd though, so I'm trying to figure out how to force i915 to be used for gfx card
So pastebin "sudo lspci -k" please.
http://paste.ubuntu.com/7371482/.  lsmod lists i915 with a 0 next to it
So it is loaded and you are using it.
but lspci -k doesn't list it, unlike under LiveCD.  also, lsmod lists i915 with a 4 next to it under LiveCD
So which Ubuntu is it?
livecd or live system?

hey all. Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5" is in my xorg.conf, but my mouse still doesnt work. do some mice report the scroll wheel as different buttons or something?
what does it say under Option "Protocol" and is it a USB or PS/2 mouse?.  also, is "Emulate3Buttons" true or false?
says it is PS/2, and it in fact is, and emulate3buttons is not on.  you get that?
yep
but, my mouse is actually USB but uses one of those USB->PS2 converter thingies. is that bad?
try enabling it and reloading X.  no, that's fine
turn on emulate3buttons?
yeah, give that a shot if your protocol is already "ExplorerPS/2".  then reload X with control+alt+backspace (but you probably already know that)
it isnt ExplorerPS/2, but just PS/2, but i will try that. thought that was only for older mice though?

isn't that to access your wireless?

how can i set the variable FLASH_FORCE_PULSEAUDIO=1 permanently, systemwide for all users
you could add it to /etc/profile
so in /etc/profile put export FLASH_FORCE_PULSEAUDIO=1. ?
that would probably do the trick. why do you want to do this anyway, if i may be so curious.?
because its the only way to get flash sound to work with pulse audio. FLASH_FORCE_PULSEAUDIO=1

hibernate in 9.04 works awesome now - i hibernated whilst playing music- on resume it played the mp3 from where it left off- awesome. but hibernate has no nice gui screen went going to hibernate. can there be a pretty hibernate gui screen?
what do you mean?
myrtti - when you boot up you have the progress bar - when shutting down - you get a progress bar. on hibernate there is no progress bar- just a ugly black screen with a cursor flasshing.

is there a way to make htop display memory usage for programs in MB? like system monitor does?
isn't that what the program top does?
im not sure. I get different outputs from top vs gnome system monitor
with top you can sort on mem usage
which column is memory usage? VIRT? RES?
virt is swap mem res is resident ram
is that the accurate usage? my music player for example shows 92m in top, and 69MiB in system monitor

how do I install gstreamer? Anyone?. I have no audio whatsoever, I need gstreamer

The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured.

How come the scripts in if-pre-up.d aren't executed when network interfaces are brought up?
"pre-up"
?
they are executed before the interface is brought up
right.  thats fine.. thats what i meant.  they arent executed at all.  thats the problem
really ?.  what type of card
my network works.. its just I made an iptables-restore script.. but it doesnt restore
thats not done in the pre-up scripts
where is it done?

so i am trying to make sure my cron job is running and it does not appear to be doing so. i have a simple script executing every single minute and have added it to the crontab file via "sudo crontab -e". however when i edit that, i notice i am editing a. temporary file.. ***** /growth/growth/testscript.sh
thats intended. the temp file is checked for syntx errors before it get copied to the "real" crontab file..  Does you script use full paths?
how often is it copied to the "real" crontab?
if it doesnt, it will not work as expected..  It will be checked and copied (or not copied) whenever you call crontab -e
no, the script looks like "ruby test.rb"
Then your script will not perform as expected. using cron, there is no user environment, not PATH defined, nothing.
so i call "crontab -e" and it is empty. i presume this means that it was not copied properly?.  ok, so fully define ruby's path as well then? gotcha
Your attempt contained errors so it was not copied..  "* * * * * /growth/growth/testscript.sh" would be correct.
that is what i have, i meant my testscript.sh file does not use full paths.
Define _every_ path fully. _never_ use relative paths..  Yeah, that applies for every script called by crontab, too.
ok so i have ***** /growth/growth/testscript.sh that i wrote after calling sudo crontab -e,
***** is wrong. there have to be whitespace in between.
that is what i meant. there is whitespace in between. and there is whitespace between the permissions and the filename.
Permissions?.  in crontab, you do not define any permissions.
sorry, schedule..  my mistake.
Yeah, and every path in your script has to be a full path. Literally every path.
i have updated all the scripts to use the full path..  so in ruby there is a function called require_relative that grabs the full path and prepends it to the file name... no idea why i would have to change that as it is embedded in the ruby files.
thats out of interest :).  but "ruby file.rb" should be "/full/path/to/ruby /full/path/to/file.rb" - the ruby code itself, unless you specify filenames, can be left unchanged.
i guess my main concern right now is why when i run crontab -e the initial command is not even showing up (regardless if the full paths of the ruby files are being included or not). like i said the only line in my testscript.sh is "/home/ubuntu/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin/ruby /growth/growth/main.rb" which is a full path. so i am not sure why after writing out that with nano it would not copy to crontab
do you quit nano like ctrl-o ctrl-x ?
yep, i have the full file path which is why i am confused as to why it is not copying to the cronjob.  yes..  ctrl-o to write out, ctrl-x to save, is that the problem?
anyone knows if such a programm exist (mobilecam over Bluetooth as webcam use)

hi, i used gparted to clone an hdd, when i switch old hdd with the new one, pc says there are no bootable disk.. what am i missing?
is the bios recognizing that "new" cloned drive
ya. as primary master
I don't have any experience with gparted for cloning, but gparted copies the MBR from the old drive as well when it clones?.  and have you loaded it back into gparted and make sure that the partitions that should be are marked as bootable?
hmm no i didn't check if they're marked as bootable.. let me see if there is an option for that
why can't I get ccsm when I search for it?
it's compiz-config-settings- manager
I can't get that either :S
that's odd... what ubuntu version?
precise
If I dual boot two linux distros and one of the installation's kernels gets updated, do I have to manually edit grub or will the distro still boot? And if so, how do I edit it (not the file, I know that, but what would change?). I mean, I know which file to edit, just not how to if I must.
depends which distro has a controlling interest in menu.lst.  or if your using a shared boot partition

My wireless doesn't work and I'm trying to fix it. From what I've read I should have the airo_cs module loaded but I don't. Is it unnecessary in 11.04 and 11.10?
which wireless chip?
Cisco Aironet (I have the airo module loaded, just not airo_cs)

I can see wireless networks but I can't connect to them, lshw -C network tells me that my wifi is Disabled

ok
does anyone know how I could go about changing /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies and scaling_max_freq to match the actual speed of my cpu? I managed to change scaling_governor to performance since it wouldn't scale up under load. but I get permission denied even using su to push a script.
those aren't changeable
is there a way to get it to recognize the 4ghz speed? It's stuck at 3.3ghz which is even lower than the stock clock.
what cpu is it
an amd fx 8320
and what does scaling_available_frequencies say
3300000 2900000 2300000 1700000 1400000. It wouldn't move past 1.7 until I turned off powersave
you should check the bios to see if it's set properly
it is, in windows it's recognized
i didn't say windows, i said bios
in bios it shows 4.0 ghz
4ghz is the turbo frequency, it wouldn't be set to that
I overclocked.. decreased the multi, dropped ram freq, etc, increased fsb, then balanced off the frequencies of ram and nb and got it stable. but for some reason, this os won't detect it
My package system is broken. I tired disabling other software sources and running sudo apt-get install -f, but it didn't fix it. This is what I got http://pastebin.com/UVHCuWC6. Can anyone help?
do you have any idea why? Give background
I'm not exactly sure. It happened when I installed WINE from the software center. At the bottom of the pastebin it shows the deb files that cause errors while processing.
why did you mention you disabled software sources?
I saw an error message that said to try disabling third party repositories and running apt-get install -f..  it did't really seem to help
pastebin: dpkg -l '*:i386' | grep '^ii'
what does that do?
it just prints information

- How do you execute Gadmin tools? I installed Gadmin tools samba from synaptic and Ic ant find it.
gsambad
- it's not in the menu anywhere?.  - gsambad and sudo gsambad wont work.
I install it from the site (*.deb) and it makes a entry, but you can type by pressing Alt-F2
- whered you find the deb package? It linked me to a totally different site when I clicked on the deb for samba.
http://gadmintools.flippedweb.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=30#Installation
- yes. I clicked that link under debian package and went to a completely diff site.
It's almost to the bottom with the Mandrive
- that's what I clicked.....  - then it goes to seer of souls.com...
one sec they changed something
- thank you.
hmm that is strange I would just download the tar file and using the Autoinstall file.
- I always hated doing stuf ffrom the tar. It's never consistent. But I installed gadmin tools samba from synaptic, it's in the repos. Why cant I find it?
this one isn't like that, you just have to run ./Autoinstall.  just do a "sudo ./Autoinstall" from within the untar directory and that is all it will take. It's not like the ./configure make make install :)
- I see it now. Just installed it..  - btw it's under applications - system tools. That's why I couldnt find it!
Great I'm not on the server and couldn't remember exactly where it was. It's got a lot going for it.
- I was previously using system-config-samba (from the repos). It's nice, but EXTREMELY basic. This gadmin tools is looking to be fantastic. Thanks for the tip man!
Not a problem I like it. Much better than going through the smb.conf and hoping you have it all done right.. Go to run have a good night all

you need an AM2+ socket CPU. If the Phenom whatever is socket AM2+ then ye
Its AM3
you should ask in ##hardware.  then no, its a different socket
But I have read they are compatible somehow
i'd ask in ##hardware to clarify

nope... not working here
you can update it from the software center then
no
how many of you use aptitude
you dont really want answers from 600 + do you?
is it better as opposed to synaptic
do what ever your comfortable with.  there is no better.  it is harder, in terms of understanding what your doing
but from what i understand it is good when uninstalling an app, is it true that it removes any depends that came along with it?
who is using firefox?. my fonts are so small!!
i am.  try Ctl-+
the problem is, that not all fonts are small. only a group of fonts

How to install visualsfm on ubuntu 16.04?
http://ccwu.me/vsfm/install.html
I tried not working. source files has been removed, 
if i want to backup my computer and i just copy the home folder would that backup my info
yes, most of it.  there are some config files in /etc that are sometimes useful depending on the progs you run.  you might want to cherry pick the important ones
would that reinstall my apps?
no, but when you did reinstall them, you could put back in your custom settings with those files

how do i go about diagnosing a consistant lockup? if i boot into the recovery mode kernel (2.6.20) the system is stable. if i boot into the regular kernel, it locks after i get to the gdm. it seemd to be time related. if i am fast enough, i can log in, but it locks before the gnome splash apears. it is a hard lock...no ctrl-alt-number terminals, no capslock leds, no hard drive activity. just a hard reset is all i can do. it seem. s to take 30 seconds to lock from the time the gdm is up.
I'd suspect a X driver issue.
even though the gdm fully shows, even the animated icon?
quite possibly, yes.  what card do you have, what driver are you using?
nvidia 6150, and the driver in the repo..  what is the command to change vid drivers. i should be able to change to a vesa driver and be stable if it is the driver, right?
you can edit your xorg.conf or run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-server - and usually vesa drivers work well, but for some reason on my radeon 9600 they hard lock :) Go figure.. so ymmv
thanks...and i have found ati cards to be the anit-logic for what should and shouldnt work =)
!xev. !info xev
ich bedanke mich
have fun :)
okay, all... I got a tough question for anybody willing to tackle it. I recently installed Hoary, got things running fine, had to update to kernel 2.6.12.2 in order to compile the latest ATI drivers for my laptop (the stable ones in the repository didn't support my X300)... everything was fine until I swapped out my DVD-ROM/CDRW for a DVD burner... I no longer have any /dev/cdrom* entries.... I checked to make sure I have SCSI support in the kernel, I do, and sg, sd_mod, and sr_mod are all modules
it really sounds like your cdrom isnt setupt he same way the other one was. jumper-wise.  make sure it's jumpered and connected exactly as your other one was
hmmm, didn't think of that -- it works fine in Windoze, so I'm not sure that's the issue

OR otherway round HOW do i sudo a drag and drop action *argh*
depends, is the floppy mounted? usually it's because it either cannot mount floppy or it cannot understand the filesystem on the floppy.  you might want to quick format the floppy first using thefloppy formatter in apps / system tools
had to mount it manually with vfat.  no i do not because its a freedos boot disk and i need to copy a firmware to it
mkfs.vfat: Attempting to create a too large file system. I am having a problem converting a drive to fat32. is there anyway I can make an NTFS partition from linux?
probably not a good idea. Another hoary question: what does one do about screen blanking? I know it is a known issue with the new xorg packages. Should these be reported? if so, how?

You have to reinstall the driver, Yasoo. It attaches itself to the kernel

hi there, anyone with experience developing an appindicator in natty? or is there a specific irc channel for devs. ?
ive seen ones written in Python at the askubuntu.com listing. :) if you want an example.
you mean answers there?
i just noticed many are at the site. and some were in python. i was going to get that one and examine the code to try to write my own.. someday. :) but never had the time
well actually im trying to build mine, but i just wanted to know how to pick my own icon. >D
how do u tell what device to use for your dvd?. sorry dvd-ram
its usually /dev/sr0
if mount fails on that dev, is it just not installed or something?
the cd/dvd should automount when you put a disk in.  are you on a server?
no its a desktop and it didnt automount.  so makes me wonder if all is ok. odd b/c the cd and dvd drive do automount, the dvd-ram doesnt
in a terminal, run "dir /etc", look for sr0. magi22: Oh its a DVD-RAM drive you're using. magi22: RAM disk I mean
nope not in there.  but cdrom and cdrom1 are not in there either (those are the devices for my cdrom and dvd drives)
Right now, if you were to put a regular CD or DVD in, does it automount?
yes the cd and dvd do but only in those drives (i have 3 drives).  anything in the dvdram doesnt mount.  auto or by guessing the mount /dev/? /mnt cmnd
I'm confused, you have 3 optical drives, 2 of which work no problem.
yes.  but those 2 dont write, i need the dvd-r

does "apt-cache policy indicator-sound" show as installed?
i see "Installed: (none)" so i assume i don't have it
install it then ;)
http://pastebin.com/d4adH2CA
looks like you have a broken package. try running "sudo apt-get -f install" and see if it helps.
just sudo apt-get -f install?
yup "sudo apt-get -f install"
http://pastebin.com/MTSDm5zL
doesn't show any broken packages! try "sudo apt-get install indicator-sound" again
indicator-applet is already the newest version.
indicator-applet or indicator-sound?
the sound icon that comes with indicator applet
i thought you said indicator-sound wasn't installed on your system..  "apt-cache policy indicator-sound" should show an installed version
i said the sound-icon wasn't appearing when i added the indicator applet
"Installed: 0.2.3-0ubuntu1"
Installed: (none) Candidate: 0.2.3-0ubuntu1
Hi guys. I have a problem with my USB external hard disk drive. It is formatted with fat32 (msdos?) and has problems being accessed by Windows 7 (viewable, transfers result in corrupted / incomplete files at a snail's pace). I use Ubuntu Jaunty principally. Some have told me to format to NTFS, but some reading has also mentioned I should stick with fat32. Which format should I use?
how much is the size of usb drive.
1 terabyte

How can i change my splashcreen in ubuntu?

ok.  u know something about point2play?
yes, but i have never used it.  GUI to cedega right ?
jeps
why is there still use :80 in the sources.list ?
your question is unparseable, but the string ":80" does not appear in /etc/apt/sources.list by default.
I see a ot of port 80 set for the repos, I still wonder why
that's not the default, are you still using your local repo?
I know it from the past and my provisioning setup get's it from somewhere, I'm not sure yet from where
has anyone here gotten network-manager up and running?
yep
what did you have to do?. i installed it, but when I try to connect to a network it scrolls and then just dies

Hi all--I upgraded to gutsy, I used to use beryl on another laptop, but when I make my selections in Advanced Desktop Effects Settings, nothing activates, no rotating cube, no windows effects... what am I doing wrong?
you need to uninstall all beryl and compiz packages and reinstall the offical ones
-the compiz things came by default, I need to uninstall those? Official packages meaning those not from synaptic?
sure, uninstall eveything with compiz or beryl in the name.  then install compiz again, double-check that you dont have any 3rd part repos in your sources
so should I do removal or 'complete removal'
so it plays using esd output?. but the gnome volume changer doesnt work?
yeah sound is working fine. Not skipping anymore at all.. Exactly.
try alsa output plugin
The little window that shows the volume appears though.
does the slider work or does it stay in one place?.  (for the gnome volume slider?)
the applet that shows up?
the speaker thing on the gnome panel.  you click it and a slider appears, windows-style?
I just got done saying that it won't add itself to the panel.
ah right. hmm.  maybe a reboot would be worth a shot?
I just rebooted and it stopped working.
maybe another reboot would make it start working then?.  worth a shot I guess
I need a good distro that has a decent ui out of box. anyone tried linux mint?

too much trouble. ok then

I have tried many many. I will try mint now

hey guys i'm interested in knowing if there are any plans in unity to implement the modal dialogs, that are already implemented in gnome 3, this is enabled in gtk3, we should start utilizing the technology, anyone know anything or where I can read about such plans?

I see, thank you for the information. Know where I can read more about the decision?
I installed apache2 with apt-get, then i removed with apt-get remove apache2 to solve some problems and erased the /etc/apach2 path.. Now i want to install apache2 again. I do apt-get install apache2 but now nothing happen. neither a path in /etc is created.. Anybody knows how to solve it?
run apt-get --purge remove apache2, then try installing again
it didnt work
how did it fail?
it seems to be erased with that command.. than i try apt-get install apache2 and Setting up apache2 (2.0.54-5ubuntu4) .... ops.  i think it was installed, but i cant found /etc/apache2
that's strange. If you succeed in fully removing it with apt-get --purge remove, it should then install cleanly (including the conf dir)
can i paste the message after remove in pvt?
Is there any way to override this protection, that protects you from installing GRUB on XFS?. I want to install 7.10 and then manually install GRUB from LiveCD.

any decent way to convert m4p files?
create a shells script with this: for i in *.m4a do faad -o - "$i" | lame -h -b 192 - "${i%m4a}mp3" done

tweak as needed.  make it executable and run
so just change the file extension to .m4p, make it executable, and then run?
hi, i have a ASUS ROG G75VW laptop with AR9485 Wireless Network Adapter (ath9k driver) and wireless n does;t work at all. won't see any n networks.... connection is stable on 2.4Ghz, but it's slow... :(. can i do anything to enable n?. !ath9k. looks like the bot doesn't know anything about ath9k
You need the ath9k_htc driver + firmware.
cool, let me look into that.  thanks :).  hm looks like my device isnt' in the supported devices list: http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/ath9k_htc/devices
enterneo, do you use dhcp on both eth0 and eth1?. enterneo, i would suggest, you use static address to eth0, eg 192.168.1.2 subnet 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.1.1, and set eth2 to dhcp. enterneo, or if you want dhcp, disable eth1
just curious.. how slow was it for you? the live part ran 15-20 minutes before it stopped at "Running local boot scripts... [ok]" on my laptop
iirc not that slow.. it stayed in the last text message for about a min or two before it loaded x server.  you should try supplying those boot parameters to kernel .. select text mode boot, then in boot prompt type expert ( or install ) acpi=off or irqpoll=off etc
k, thx
how new is the laptop? latest laptops using intel chipsets like 965 and core2duo use EFI BIOSes and pose those problems, eg with usb legacy option

they will need your hostname or IP address
Cafuego, I have tried putting my ip address into the browser and it comes up saying i need a user name and password to get into my dlink moderm.
Then you need to set up the d-link modem to forward tcp port 80 to the internal IP of your Linux machine.
how do I do that?
can anyone tell me what the command is for the Users and Groups tool?

thanks!
it's in system > administration.  all the gnome tools have the same naming convention- for example the network tool is network-admin

Anyone with some experience with ACPI and sleep? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2203563 The lid open/close ACPI events are recognized but the laptop is not waking up on lid open :(
i personally never use "sleep" or "hibernation" ... it's useless.  but, you could try out the "gnome-tweak-tool" or smth like that. yap, the computer on idle, with monitor turned off, doesn't eat up that much power. why would anyone use the "sleep" mode?

any how can i make teamspeak use alsa
/dev/dsp is oss, configure xmms to use alsa, and configure teamspeak to use alsa
xmms is using alsa. but how can i make TS use alsa
does it have no option to select alsa?.  assuming the teamspeak binary is named 'teamspeak' try this as root (sudo su to get root) # echo "teamspeak 0 0 direct" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
theres only three options in TS for sound devices: 1.default (oss/dev/dsp), 2.default network 3.other
try what I said, replacing 'teamspeak' with the name of the teamspeak binary.  running teamspeak through 'aoss' might also work

Several events/applications make a sound through my PC's internal speaker, is there any way to get these events/applications to use the sounds defined in the ubuntu sound settings?
blacklist the pcspkr module
How? And will that make it use the right sounds, or just make it stop using the internal speaker?
in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
OK, but will it start playing the right sounds by doing that? I still prefer the internal beep rather than no sound at all
well, i am not quite sure
Is there any way to just unload that module temporarily to test?

hello i have a problem with encrypted drive on which Ubuntu is installed. it is while loading sends me to initramfs. without password prompt. I am able to access the drive from live usb with error 'file system not found' but I can browse through content. I also get an error of misssing superblock, I would like to know how can I restore it from live usb
Is the command `cryptsetup` available in initramfs?
I am not aware of that now, as I worked all day through live usb, but apparently no I think it was not.  to find out I have to disconnect and try it out, which is unlikely in my situation right now, as I have some preference to set up to run system again, so it would be time consuming.  btw it is Ubuntu 17 and I have succesfully fixed some issues with an encrypted swap (freezing system) and I didn't not finalize the operation apparently, then I haven't reboot the system for a long time and apparently after the crash there was different kernel that was the issue. The drive on the system is SSD so I did not think it is bad block or anything related. Sorry for a confusing lot of information!. https://askubuntu.com/questions/922319/ubuntu-17-04-freezing-issue# - here is what the freezing issue was, and the thing i haven't done is I did not checked /etc/fstab parameters - I suspect this is the reason for current problems. https://askubuntu.com/questions/922319/ubuntu-17-04-freezing-issue# - from that post

Do i need to partiton the external or use advanced install?
you shouldn't need to no. I would guess the problem is with the bootloader. Did you say you selected the boot device from the bios menu, and then didn't get a grub prompt, or you booted as normal and selected the new install from the grub prompt, and then got nothing?
i selected it from bios and then didnt get grub. just a black screen with flashing line. when i select the 8gb usb in bios it just boots straight to it though
thats because the bootloader is installed on the usb stick. You'll need to install grub to the external drive, or one of your internal drives
ooh i see. I thought it installed grub as well to the external.

so I hear the wi-fi auto-config in the newest release is fairly agressive?
define aggressive.  xkcd exaggerates beyond the point of absurdity
shoot. I was just typing that
I just upgraded to Dapper - I think. How can I verify that that the upgrade took?
did you reboot?
yes
isn't the desktop sharing a desktop service, in that it requires the user to login to start it
yep.
so how can you expect to share a desktop thats not been "logged in" yet. wouldn't it be better to enable the desktop sharing as a session service so that the second the user logs in the desktop sharing service is started
ok so i downloaded the icon to desktop, what do i do now?. what do i do once i have the bz2 icon package. what do i do once i have the bz2 icon package. how do i install them?. what command to get bmp?. apt-get install bmp?

What?
kaldam: which version(s) of Ubuntu? By any chance are you running into a 128/256 byte inode issue?
possibly.. im using 8.10. im pretty sure its something to do with the file system. and the way ubuntu has formatted it
you can check with tune2fs to see the inode size. Older systems won't handle 256 byte inodes, but that appears to be the default for new releases.
ah
just a guess, but easy enough to check.
yeah.  what switch is it ;). for tune2fs. to identify inode count. -l isnt it :P
yes, the -l
and yes your right. the working FS has an inode size of 128, while ubuntu's is using 256
you have Inode size: 256 instead of Inode size: 128 ?
so i migth change that  and see if it works, ill email the guy at fs-driver and ask him if it he's planning on making it work with 256 sized inodes. also  the directory hash is different. the working drive is using tea, while the other is using half_md4
tune2fs can change those for you. -I and -E. See the man page.
hi, my system (4 cpus) has load 25, but the cpus idle, no swapping or other i/o is happening and the system does not feel sluggish. what could that be?
load what?
system load as shown by e.g. uptime
that I do know... however some people thinks that CPU usage is the same as load... which it isn't...
the load displayed by uptime is 25 and i do not know the reason for it. i'd like to find out what causes this load.. any ideas where to look
nadie me ayuda en ingles tampoco. aqui?
si no te ayudan es por que nadie tiene una respuesta, intenta preguntar otra vez en otro tiempo, puedes usar el foro mientras esperas
i figured as much, and ive already pured through forums. but will keep trying
how can i run a script when my screensaver is executed?
I don't know of anything to do that. What do you want to happen?
Well, right now it's so I can dismount certain encrypted volumes I don't want mounted when they aren't in use. I have a solution but it's one I don't like; I'll rename gnome-screensaver to gnome-screensaver-bin and replace the original with a shell script more than likely is what i will do
that's not a horrible option. The other thing you could do is have a cron task that checks if the screen saver is running every 5 min
well maybe not horrible but it seems like there should be something in place to do that already. ive skimmed all the config files to no avail too. hadnt thought to check to see if the screensaver was running. i prefer that..  the reason i dont like to do "Wrapper" scripts is because it complicates uninstalling programs if i forget ive wrapped them later on.
I'd do the cron if I were you - easy check
yeah, that's probably what i will end up doing. thanks. i was trying to think of how to do it with cron but it never dawned on me to check to see if the screensaver was running. too much time on windows. anyway, thanks a lot.
hi is there a good a good antivirus out there for linux (excl. avast & clamav)
you dont need a anti virus

Okay, so. I've got 8.04 and an ipw3945 using the iwl3945 driver. It connects to my home access point just fine, as well as the one at my parent's house. However, for some reason, it won't connect to the access points at school. They use MAC filtering and open authentication, but even when I spoof a known-good MAC, it's no good. Am I asking in the right place? If so, where should I start troubleshooting it?
wrong plcace. place*
Where's the right place, then?
hello? looking for support here....
@ what is your problem? Maybe we could help you ^_^
My Luks partition (with system and all data) got damaged and I would like to recover the data from it... the problem is that this kind of partition is encrypted and normal recovery is impossible
do you remember your key?
that's not the point... it stopped to be visible as Luks partition and it's visible as unknown one
Yes, because it's encrypted, it cannot detect the file system, you have to decrypt it.
I had backuped some of the data on an PenDrive (Usb stick), but it seem that this ubuntu (12) has caused that it has been damaged in hardware way >.<. and no, I can't do any kind of raid when I have data on this disk... doing raid may damage them
@... You could try to backup your full partition with dd >.<. And mess with it after...
@ what would that give? I will remain in the same point as I'm now
Hey evrybody, I got the file I wanted and got it unzipped, how do I find out where it went, and how do I gte the thing to install?
probably in your home. or desktop
I finally found it just now, how do I install it, its a tar file.  its a printer driver
oh, you got it on moderated
i went to +m first, as i don thave an alias to the other
hey everyone, bear with us for one moment, we apologize for this.  that is perfect actually, because my rr didn't work at first :)

I got a 2ghz 512 ram 128 mb video card Gnome too heavy for it?
no should zork.  no should work

catting /proc/cpuinfo is returning 1ghz for both my cores, but they are faster than that, is the detection busted in feisty x64?
No, your cores are throttled: the computer slows them down when they are idle to save power. They are put back at full speed when needed.
thank you very much.
Hello there something is wrong with my ubuntu server. I went to bed last night and awoke to no mysql : start: Job failed to start : Do I have to re-install mysql ? when I try to connect via: mysql -u username -p : I get this error :ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2): any idea of what might be going on ?
Is the server running?
yep. I am ssh'd in right now.  everything is rinning great but mysql. running *
Can you locate the error-logfile for mysql and post it in pastebin?
that is under var ? 
No, is the mysql server running on your system?.  Yes, but check first if the server is running
no the service is not running and I can not get it to start
kk, then paste the errorlog.  It should be under /var/log/mysql/error.log
you want the whole thing or tail ?
how do I get a list of packages installed on my box in xterm?
dpkg -l
is it possible to get rid of unused softwares easily?
in the software manager you can remove the software you don't need.  start here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoftwareManagement
thanks 
Ok so. I'm having problems with my wifi. it stopped working all of a sudden. the restricted driver is enabled - but it says "not in use"
and you rebooted the AP?
Yes --- I booted into an ubuntu live CD and everything works. So that rules out hardware failure of any kind
how do I find out the permissions of a file at terminal and relate the results to the number that represents those permissions?
rather.  and http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml will help you understand the permissions.
thanks. but first I need to see what a file is set at.. from there I can make the change I need and then change it back to what it was.
ls -la will show what it's set at, .  if you do ls -la, paste the rwx.. values, i'll tell you what number it is.. you can go from there
thanks.. ls -l also seems to report the values.. -rw-r--r-.  766?
yep :)
:_. :))
now check that link i pasted, it'll help explain how it all comes together.
k
is there a key command to hold while clicking something in Firefox to temporarily bypass the pop-up blocker?
not sure but the standard i think is holding down control button while clicking links
doesn't seem to work for me, tried shift, alt, ctrl
otherwise you could click the popupblocker icon thingy and choose it to not block that site
i think that allows all popups for that URL, i just want to temporarily allow one pop-up
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary main restricted universe multiverse. that line SHOULD include that package, nay?

hi, does anyone know why my pidgin notify-osd popups seem misplaced on natty?. it's like they are placed a bit too low, so there would always fit another notification between it and the border of the screen
It's "intended"
it sucks :P
There's a tool to bring them back to a normal place, I just don't remember what. Probably ubuntu-tweak
gonna look into it, thank you. i don't see any valid reason to place notifications anywhere else than in a corner :)
Ubuntu devs reserved the corner for "VERY important" notifications
i'd also like to have the app come to front when clicking on them as that's intentional behaviour, instead of clicking throug them.
i.e. volume change things xD
that's somewhat stupid, if you ask me. a huge usability fail

how do you log into file manager as sudo?. i have 9 xorg.conf files. and i need to delete some so I can get my screen out of 640-480. any ideas...or do i have invisible font
The only xorg.conf that matters is the one called '/etc/X11/xorg.conf' - any others are ignored.
is it possible to delete the old ones in file manager
Yeah..  But it's even easier to just do 'sudo rm /path/to/unusedxorg.conf'
also i did the fixvideoresolution steps in the wiki resolution still way to low
can anyone please help me in installing windows vista on virtualbox 3.0 on intrepid ??!
make an iso of the vista
i have a bootable disk...won't that work ?
no luck, still stuck with tk 8.3.5 and i need 8.5 for amsn
Did you try sudo dpkg-reconfigure tk and also dpkg-reconfigure tcl?
yes
Also, is you AMsn from the repo of downloaded and compiled?
downloaded and compiled.. the repo is about a year old.
Have you removed it and removed 8.5, reinstall tk 8.5 and then reinstall AMSN?
i tried doing tk, i'll try tcl too
Normally, TK and TCL are almost tied together...
nope, removed them with --purge and then reinstalled, still says 8.3.5 :(.  not only this, after purging tcl-8.5, i still have tclsh. so it appears i have another TCL installation somehow, although i really don't know how i ended up with it

what is the best way to setup redundant storage? I'm thinking of mdadm as raid5, but can only use 1 drive at the moment.
you seriously want to use redundant storage on a single drive??? If that is honestly what you want to do, you can set up RAID by partition rather than by drives. Seems like a bad idea to me, though
no, I have a drive I can devote now, and in the next few days move 2 drives into the array
aah. I've been using btrfs, which (for me) has been the easiest way to deal with this. Can add extra drives/partitions at will. Although someone on here mentioned there is a bug in btrfs rebalancing on the current Wily kernel, so maybe not a great idea right now
yea, I have 3x drives, 1 was pairity and the other 2 are xfs; these came from unRAID and I'm switching to ubuntu
you need to keep xfs?
no, but I need to keep the data, so I was going to use 1 drive and move the data over 1 drive at at time.. *at a.  currenlty I put LVM on the <was parity> disk and can migrate data to the new LVM, however don't know how I would do parity from that. unRAID uses separate xfs partitioned drives and somehow creates a parity drive (I don't think it technically uses a RAID)
well, if btrfs is stable enough for you (and RAID5 on btrfs is _almost_ stable) it makes this kind of thing easy. You could migrate from flat format to RAID1 to RAID5 in easy increments, without the complexity of LVM etc. I'm afraid it is so long since I had to mess about with LVM or mdraid I forget how to do this otherwise.  but I'm probably just pushing my favoured way on to you
I think I understand LVM enough, but it doesn't have parity options (that I know of); I would mostly use the drives for media storage w/a small handful of VMs running on it that I would prefer to be highly available.... I liked how unRAID made it easy to have a redundant array, but it would seemingly boot completely, wait 6min, then *finally* start booting the VMs...
to be honest, I've come to the conclusion that RAID is more hassle than it is worth with the multi-terabyte drives I have in my desktop these days. I've abandoned it for bcache and rotational backups. Rebuilding an array is just a pain
yea, that's what I'm thinking (hence me being hesitant to jump on a RAID); I do have this data in an offsite location that I very loosely sync with; I would like to do a parity, ideally fs independent and non RAID; but I guess I could be asking too much...
when I try to mount a partition on my second disk(hdb), I get this error "mount: /dev/hdb1 already mounted or /second busy" when either of those are not true.. any clues
double check your fstab, just to see?
i did .. "mount|grep hdb" gives me no output
paste your /etc/fstab to pastebin?
i don't see u in #pastebin
then type in from this link where it says Identifier "intel 965" but don't type that. http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=54960. so type Driver "intel" VendorName "Intel Corp", etc
ok
and then delete the Option that used to be in there (the FBdev one. wait. before you do this. type Escape :q!
ok
now type cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.backup. (you should have been back in the terminal after escape :q!

has anyone successfully installed beryl + aiglx with a Radeon 9800 Pro???
Working with my 9700 Pro.
did u follow a particular guide?
No. It's an R300, it's supposed by the open source drivers..  The 9800, I suspect, probably isn't an R300?
how can i find out?
Google.. Unless you boot of the windows installer CD.. That does. :). Such as?. Windows can't read Linux partitions, so other than the MBR, there isn't anyhting for it.. It does not do that.
xorg.cong has it as a R350 NH
Then it's not supported.
i do have drivers installed. fglrx
Those do not support AIGLX.. And likely never will.. Heh.
=(
You can use xgl though.. Which is different from AIGLX.
the xorg-driver-fglrx is not open source??
No. It's ATI's propriatary drive.
ic
The "radeon" driver is open source, and has recent support for full acceleration on R300 and below.. But not yet above.. So, with an R300, it "Just Works"
got u
Obviously guys are working hard to make it work with yoru card, but ya know, it's closed stuff. It's very hard. ;)
any trustworthy guides for the 9800 card?
I suspect any Xgl guide can do it fo ryou.. It's the same then.
what does OSS stands for?
open source software.  or open source system.  or probably 400 other things
ok. lol
Hi all, I'm trying to connect to another X11 server (so I want client applications on my machine to display on a screen attached on another machine). I don't want to enable tcp on the remote server, so I need to connect to the unix-socket over there. How can I do this?
just use X forwarding :). ssh -X my_host
read again. that's the other way around
Hey guys. Anyone know about forcing display resolutions?
such as with xrandr?
Well I'm really new to linux, so I haven't a clue to what that is
lspci doesn't detect my saa7134 tv-card anymore, and dmesg reports something about a pci interrupt at IRQ 11 -- could it have something to do with that?. specifically; ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:0c.0[A] -> Link [LNKA] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
kernel-version?
2.6.15-26.  -386
hmm... that should work. only 2.6.17 has a typo in it that busts saa 7134 support.  what do dmesg and lspci say?
lspci says nothing about it since it disappeared, and dmesg doesn't say any interesting stuff other than that oci interrupt thingy.  I'll just paste it at pastebin to see if you can find anything I can't
but it worked before? ... card broken? try different pci-slot... firmware issues?
perhaps card broken, I hope not. I'll try a different pci-slot.  http://pastebin.com/777107
you're right, nothing remarkable in there, except the total absence of the card being noticed
okay. What did you mean by firmware issues?
some cards need a firmware uploaded to them at boot to function properly. But this is not the case with you, you'd get a notice in dmesg
okay, I'll try a different pci slot then.  I'll be back in a reboot
c u
no luck :(
is there a room for firewalls and security?
YES
what is it?
macrobad left
well, it was 4:30 where he is.  what do you need?.  I'm afraid I wasn't paying enough attention while you were talking with him earlier.
well, i cant get my wifi to work. he gave me some files and it didnt work
and I can't get my ethernet to work ;)
i can see my network but i cant connect to it, but i can connect to open networks
hmm. did they return any error messages?
the files blocked me from connect to my rj45. so im glad i saved the backups like he said
how install x on my ubuntu?
mini.iso install ?
i would like to install using apt
mini.iso install ?
what?
how did you install ubuntu ?
in my virtual box using ubuntu-14.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso
so you do have X.  xdpyinfo | grep version
look here: http://ideone.com/70RGw5
what's that ?
http://ideone.com/DBFWCS.  thats R studio installing a lib and it complains that it cannot find X and X11
yes.... but if you have a desktop, X (for ubuntu ) is ok... it'a a config/comp issue with that source
fendur: how can i fix the config issue?
what is the source link ?
where?
from where did you take that package from ?
in sources.list?.  do you talk about the source in R studio trying to install right?
right.  from here https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=234 ?
this package is downloaded automatically.  i check where from.  see here: http://ideone.com/70RGw5.  ideone hides the link....  from https://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib/rgl_0.95.1441.tar.gz
i don't get that error in configure ...
./configure ?
yes.  you miss some -dev packages
ok which ones? :D.  libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev ?
have you read the README ?.  start with those
now configure shows no error :D
Hi guys! Before i upgraded to Hardy didn't my mounted drives get an icon on the desktop, but now they does. I thought that Ubuntu only placed icons on the desktop for drives mounted in /media ?
check in gconf-editor under apps - nautilus - desktop (untick volumes_visible)
But If I uncheck that one, will icons be visible for USB, external HD etc. ?
nope, they will probabably disappear too
Ok, you don't know any other way? In the earlier version I think it helped to mount the volumes in any other place then /media, but now it seems like it doesn't work anymore..

One of my Ubuntu 8.04.1 computers has the inetd process running, another not. Why do I need the process inetd? Reading man inetd did not enlighten me.
you don't "need" the inetd process, thats up to you if you want to use it, some applications such as telnet/mail/swat etc etc, can be wrapped with inetd to be "launch on demand"

trying to get output to a TV. I have a DVI to VGA adapter on my graphics card, and it outputs to my VGA monitor fine. I have a VGA to component video cable, and my TV set says its not getting any signal from the component cable. Any thoughts?
What graphics driver are you using?
the proprietary ATI FGLRX driver
It should support the randr extension afaik.. you might want to check 'xrandr'.  You may have to explicitly tell it to enable the output since it probably won't detect your tv being plugged through the VGA adapter
do you know a walkthrough on how to do that? not sure I'd know how
http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12
thanks, I'll go read and give that a shot

u using wine to play it?
besides it fails to recognize that i have already ms windows installed
can you get into console mode at all?
nopr. no
you might need to load the live cd again and then do a repair console...then you could try typing update-grub
how do i do that. ?
put the cd back in the drive and reboot...when it comes up there will be a choice for a recover console or something like that
i already looked for that but i dont see a recover console
you could just try reinstalling as it sounds like grub was not loaded anyways
i tryd two times. and it gave me the same error
does it give you that error when you reboot or during install?
during install. more precisely in the end
are you using a raid array?

how would I completely remove any trace of a program?. because I uninstalled privoxy, and now reinstalling it is giving me hella errors
which program?.  paste the errors to #flood
done
sudo dpkg -P privoxy ; sudo aptitude -y install privoxy
I get the exact same error
add "set -x" (no quotes) as the second line of /var/lib/dpkg/info/privoxy.postinst, then rnu the above commands again, and paste the output to #flood
oh man, when your installer says Ack!. you're screwed. I pasted my privoxy stuff, 
sure you edited the postinst script correctly?
yep. first line is set -s. second line is set -x. should I get rid of "set -e"?
How to start nautilus
click the icon or from a terminal run `nautilus`
Does not start
was there any output from terminal?
A bunch of failed notes and a window with home
please paste the output to a pastebin (paste.ubuntu.com) and link here
https://pastebin.com/dkMs5u5J
well, you don't wanna use `sudo` witha gtk program but that's beside the point here.
I used su.gksu.gksudo and nothing works
`killall nautilus && nautilus`. k bye
https://pastebin.com/k1tACSFk and i got a home window
what does `nautilus -c` show?
https://pastebin.com/h4UQXQQi
ok. have you tried a reboot?. not a solution, but it does usually fix nautilus in this case.
Will try to reboot again.  It still opens the failed list and a home window.  nautilus -c show the self check
what do you mean by "home window"
Under the icon files a window open called home which contains files such as documents desktop Downloads etc
hello - i am currently having a wireless network error on my xubuntu install - iwconfig essid "ESSID" etc - i did that - dhclient wlan0 returns "no dhcpoffers received"
you can try assigning a static IP if the link layer is up
"link layer"?. and where do i assign a static ip?
try #ip link
was that supposed to do anything?
it lists all your interfaces
it didnt list anything
on the link layer, for example, my line on wlan0 says: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>
ok i've got
does it say they interface is up?
no-carrior,broadcast,multicast,up>
the wireless link isn't up then
em then how do i put it up
when you type 'sudo iwconfig' does it show a MAC address next to "Access Point:"?
yes
then try: ip link set wlan0 up.  i like the ip command more than ifconfig, ifconfig is a wrapper on the ip command, and i find the original easier
well ok. but i still have the problem lol
does 'ip link' show the interface as 'UP' now?
<No-carrier,broadcast,multicast,up>. ^no change from what it was
that no-carrier think basically means that the 'cable is unplugged'.  there's no link.  what's the signal strength? (Link Quality under iwconfig)
0. oh shit. all my stuff was removed. one sec. Link Quality:0. but under nmap applet - my router is shown. with a connection
Hi. I've enabled suspend with: dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend. It works but when I try resume, a kernel panic occurs or desktop is unusable. If I launch chromium by the terminal, I get: pcilib: Cannot open /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.1/resource: No such file or directory. How can I solve this problem?
don't suspend?
the suspend works, the resume no
if you don't suspend, you don't have to resume
but I can suspend
ok, then don't resume
but I must resume
but it doesn't work
if I suspend.  it resume, but bad. *resumes

Do I have to run anything after I have modified /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
update-grub, if you've maintained the debian style configuration format in there
but how does update-grub know not to "generate the menu.lst"?
i don't know much about it, but it does the biz.
cause the manual says first time you run it i generates the list.  then "The user must set the two options update-grub uses. Then re-run the update-grub script to update the menu.lst file using the default's that have been set".  So I wanna know its not gonna generate the list. I want it just to update with my additions.
you can trust the manual more than me
=)
try without doing it, see if your changes have been applied
well I havnt run it once yet. Surly you have to run it at least once. I did with lilo
good morning
its night
i just stand up a few minutes ago. must work tonight :(
Ok

what does 'ldd' say about the binary?

server_linux: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped.  I can read the file fine, I just can't run it
read it?.  its a binary...
like with vim and cat. I can see that its there, and the data

Hi all, I am trying to install a driver for my tv card. It calls up the file-roller. As a newbie I don't konw what to do with it!
is the file a .tar.gz ?
Yep (fancy meeting you again!)
to untar it, do tar xvzf <filename>
Do i download it first then?.  When i tried before it just opened it in the file roller
how do i specify what driver i want to use for some piece of hardware?. ie to specify the correct driver for my wifi card?
i think the realtek driver you have is for older kernel. try this. looks very promising. http://willdaniels.co.uk/articles/howto-guides/10-howto/12-r8180-hardy
thankyou :) what is currentkernel ?
I meant this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbiquityPreserveHome
yes, it is. Go into the advanced parititoner and make sure the format checkbox isn't checked for your root partition.
thx, this is the same in ubuntu, kubuntu and xubuntu I assume?
Yes. One last point: please make sure you have backups.
excellent, thanks
what is yobbobandana? what might get messed up if i purge it?
a game
orly? wonder how that got there :/. is there a simple command to purge a ppa?
i have a grub problem. i followed the directions in the WIKI to make a back up of my master boot record. but it seems to have done something to the MBR. now I get this:. GRUB loading, please wait.... then hangs. forever. no errors. i had to use the Windows XP disk to rewrite the MBR. but now i can't access my Ubuntu install. oh, and the grub floppy doesn't work either, it does the same exact thing
try to boot with ubuntu cd
i have but there are no tools for rewriting the mbr, short of reinstalling and i'd rather not do that
i'm playing with webimn ... but can't login. It say i need the root pwd but on ubuntu it dosn't exist ... any idea ?.  try with live, chroot the root of your li. chroot and do a grub-install
you've lost me. chroot?.  you mean, download the live cd?.  what does "chroot the root of your li" mean?
u don't own any cd with linux on it ?. if u own a fedora cd boot it into rescue mode and follow on screen info
i have a Ubuntu cd, several Mandrake cds and a Knoppic cd. *knoppix
use mandrake... i think they have the rescue option
Mandrake doesn't use GRUB. so i don't see what good that would do
from 9 mndrake use grub.. but isn't so important. u need to get into system
MDK 9 doesn't use GRUB
than mount your linux root and issue chroot <mount point>. u will have a virtual root filesystem to use .
then what?
when u have it u can do a grub-install .
how can i do a grub-install when grub isn't available on the mandrake disk?
when u chroot u got the ubuntu system.
ok. i guess i'll give it a try
it's so easy doing it than explain ... *grin*
but will it redetect my windows install?
grub-install reinstall the grub with the file that reside on disk ... (i think) :)
but the file on disk isn't working?!?!. i mean, isn't that why grub won't come up?. i'm confused
i m getting following error during update -W: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net lucid Release: (The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY EC7B7B7D4439DBD6 ). anyone have solution
import the gpg key
how can i do so
did you add a ppa, if so which one?
how can i do so...because i am getting only option for export ...in password and encryption application
yes they have the same file name. but it dosenot work
what program are you using then?
vlc. do u know better?
question, do i want to set the bootable mode for my ext3 partition to on or off
depends if you want to boot from it or not?
i want to be able to see it in the boot menu and load into it so i can use it
only the partition(s) that will have a boot loader installed needs to have the boot flag set...
so that would mean only my windows vista partition...right>
can serving web pages be parallelized?
already is.  if you fire up apache it starts 6 or so processes... if the webserver gets a lot of hits it starts even more
so if you had more than one computer acting as the web serving it will be able to process faster?
oh. that's load distributions.  there's several ways to do that... the easiest to round-robin DNS
does that mean every computer has a mirror of the files on the server?
basically.  you setup a couple of machines with exactly the same document root.  then you setup DNS with multiple A records.  like:. www A 192.168.0.1. www A 192.168.0.2. and then randomly, when people go to www.yoursite.com they'll go to one machine or the other
yep
there are a lot more advanced methods too that might work out better for you
how would that work with reading and writing to mysql databases
as long as you use a single database and the webservers themselves are stateless, you're fine.  things like phpbb, for example, are fine
so all the htdocs and mysql database are on one machine, but the others link to it?
any known RhythmBox iPhone remotes?? (control playback over wifi with an iPhone) ??

yep thats what iam talking about 
i dont think theres any left handed shape cursors in by default. try gnome-look or similar site they have cursors. look under x11-cursors
alright, thank you in advance! :). There's a question left, how to i install the packages i get from gnome-look.org?. do*
How do I enable new panel widgets with unity?. Like the weather one, etc

wifi with an encryption key doesn't always work for using Ubuntu. ( or other Linux distros for that matter ). I should just buy a centrino laptop

not sure
thats what I'm trying to setup. I had it working before but now I just can't get it to work
Have you tried ****-****-** with your encryption key
I don
I don?. what does that mean?
don't quite understand what yuo mean by ****-***-***. typo sorrie dude.  sorry that was a typo earlier. Redeyess: I dont quite understans what you mean by ****-***-**.  can you please explain. gouki: you there?
the key should be in the format " ****-****-** ". after each 4 digits/letters there should be a dash
I just enter my key under system->admin->networking and it doesn't give the option of a specific format. Redeyess: but I can't seem to get to ping the router. both amber and green LED's flash on the card

I'm using xchat. It makes the text I type a bizarre faded grey. I can figure out how to change the standard text, but I can't figure out how to make my text look any less sickly. How can I do this?
ist in the color profile. Look at yoru color preferences. The list of colors you see there, find the one that loosk like the color of you text. I personally use irssi, its better.
I can't find it in the color profile (at least in the preferences window). There's 3 categories: text colors (foreground, background), marking text (foreground, background) and interface colors (new data, marker line, new message, away user, highlight). Which one of those do I change to change my user text? Or is there an .xchatrc sort of file I need to edit?
its the text colors. Interface > colors > text colors (find the one you need to change and change it).  its the text colors. Interface > colors > text colors (find the one you need to change and change it)
Which option under 'text colors' do I change? I'm looking at the window right now and nothing says anything that even implies my own personal user text? I can't figure out what to change
look at this screenshot. If you dont see this, then you either are not looking in the right spot or are not using XChat (XChat Gnome isnt the same) -- http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/7798/screenshot4q.png -- change one of those
which one of those? do you know?

what shortcut did you give it?
just A. thus, the problem. it is still recognizing A As A shortcut for some reAson.
I mean what was the thing you set 'a' to ?
oh. Uhm... ring switcher, next window (All workspAces)
run gconf-editor, navigate the tree on the left to /apps/compiz/plugins/switcher/allscreens/options , you should find it in the panel on the right. When you do, right click it and select unset key
problem: I've AlreAdy unset the shortcut. It still won't let me hAve my key bAck.
in gconf-editor?
gconf-editor shows thAt i've unset the key... it dosen't show the shortcut for 'A' Anymore.
bummer.
though, i suppose i could get used to hitting shift A lot... though, i'll hAve to explAin my strAnge cApitAlizAtion rules...

nope ...  gnome
oh, ok
why does it matter ? i wont it to run as a daemon before gnome even starts anyway ..
oh, ok that makes it easier (never really used gnome).  you can create a init script
where should i place it ?
there should be a file called /etc/init.d/skeleton.  it's a template what it should look like
i see... once i create it, where should i place it ?
put it in /etc/init.d

having serious trouble trying to do system update / upgrade
where are you stuck?
well, updates haven't been working. then i tried "dpkg --configure -a" & that gets stuck
have you added any ppas?
probably but nothing too weird.. just firefox nightly, clementine.. i should comment them out of sources & try apt-get?
yes
where is sources?
/etc/apt
is the only file in question sources.list?
you might want to check the directory too sources.list.d
E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.

Hi all. How can I upgrade from 14.10 to 15.04 from command line?
you shouldn't do that. 15.04 is in development
thanks for advice, but why not?.  already beta 2 :)
if you can't figure out how to upgrade - you shouldn't be using beta software
you even don't know how I am using it, how can you judge? :)
becuse you don't know how to upgrade
okm someone else will help me than, no problem :)
Does 12.04 have a way to show System Info permanently somehow? I seriously miss the applets you could put in pre-Unity toolbars.
theres exxtra indicator-applets you can get. askubuntu.com had a huge list of them all at one time
do they tuck into the Unity sidebar, or up in the notification area?

how do I sudo an X application?? I am in Kate copying and pasting different parts of a config file, and need to save it, but the regular user doesn't have rights to save to the same directory. In the past I have saved it to my home dir, then sudo'ed and copied it manually.. just trying to see if I can save a step
in a terminal type sudo kate path/filename
will that make Kate sudo'ed for any other files I open in it?
as long as kate remains open and you open other files from withing kate. Once you close it, no more sudo
awesome.. thanks!!

If I wanted to make a iso off a USB drive that is Windows mountable, can't I just dd if=/dev/usb-device-name or should I do if=/dev/usb-device-partition. i.e. /dev/sdg vs /dev/sdg1
depends what the format of the iso is
I am actually going th eother way: usb->iso

remove it with synaptic and use COMPLETE removal.  that will delete the config files, which lets you install a clean vmware

yes hold on
I installed from a tarball and I have removed the old stuff but the new install says I have a kernel mismatch

Quick question. I currently have 11.04 installed on my desktop, and I want to dual boot win7. Would it be easier/better to backup 11.04, install win7, then install 11.04, or just install win7
I always install Microsoft Windows 7 first on a system, then install Linux distributions.
!backup. ugh, ment to send that to myself, sorry
Windows is more particular about where it can be installed, if you've used all your primary partitions with Linux, for instance, the Windows boot loader will be a problematic install. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_partition#Primary_partition
I was planning on installing it on a separate harddrive..  think windows would have an issue with that?

Had desktop effects working fine about two hours ago, trying to fix some weird issue led me to thinking I should install the open source radeon drivers. But I was apparently doing something wrong in the installation process, because everytime I run gdm restart it just goes to black screen
Can you not just remove the radeon drivers?.  Or are you trying to find a solution that keeps them but also makes the rest work?
well. I ran dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. To get a default blank xorg.conf. And now I can't get desktop effects enabled or anything
So you're using a blank xorg.conf right now?
Mhmm. should I try out that debx or whatever thing
Have you tried it without having an xorg.conf at all?
no didn't know that was even possible
: I don't know what you mean by "debx or whatever thing"
some sort of configuration tool for xorg.conf
If you type "Xorg -configure" at a commandline, the X server will attempt to configure itself based on what it detects
hmmmm. lemme try
I've got 3 files, how can I join them up into one big file? I don't mean like an archive or anything, literally just 3 files, end on end, as one file

is it binary safe?
I've created and added my current user to a new group, with 'adduser username groupname', and when I run 'groups username', I see that group listed, but when I run 'groups' as that user, the new group is not listed. Do I need to do something to "reload" my group permissions or somesuch?
Did you log off and login as that user?
Nope, is that what needs to be done?
hey all, can someone give me a hand with a hardrive config?
you mean the fstab?
yes

How can I make ufw allow outgoing connections from my local network through my router/server where I am running ufw? It seems to block all connections.. I've enabled nat/masquerading, and I have set up a dhcp server, so IPs are being distributed correctly. Only outgoing connections from my server/router seem to work, not from behind it.. I did a sudo ufw allow out from 10.0.0.0/24, but still no luck. Also sudo ufw default deny incoming.. How do I allow trafic to pass by my router that is running ufw?. From my local network to the WAN?
got IP forwarding enabled to start with?. hi
As far as I can tell, yes.  How can I verify?
so that means you're not sure? :) "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" i believe, should be 1 if it's enabled
Oh, yeah, that I have enabled.  I see "UFW AUDIT" logs comming up for packets coming from my LAN to the router, and vice versa..  However "UFW ALLOW" from router to WAN
!ufw.  i don't think you've done enough required reading for what you're trying to do. have a look at the above.

How do I find out where my new IDE drive is? I've already formatted it to etx3 but when I try to mount it (/dev/hdc/) it says it cant find it.
what does sudo fdisk -l tell you?
checking.  /dev/hdc1 1 38913 312568641 83 Linux.  I missed the 1!. I think its mounted, checking
:-)
Yep! Free Space: 278.3 GB. Now to get it into fstab =)
nice size
Thanks, preparing to clear out a windows box with 6 drives (Collecting the data to one drive).  When I browse it through nataulis I can't create a folder or file (Right clicking)
how does fstab list it?
/dev/hdc /media/320gb auto 0 0.  Am I missing rw?
try this ... /dev/hdc1 /mnt/newdrive ext3 defaults 0 0 .... whatever u want to call mount point and better under mnt than media as that is where removables typically get mounted.  get the correct spaces in that line!
/dev/hdc1 /media/320gb auto defaults 0 0 (This is a temporary mount to move 250gbs of data).  I missed ext3

Ok, I am going to try to reboot. I've checked (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29016/) and did a mount -a but I still cant make a folder in it. I think maybe rebooting this might do the trick.
reboot shouldn't be necessary mount -a will reread the fstab
ok.  I wonder if its simple permmissions?
yep
Thats what it is =)
on the mnt/...
yes, so I'll chown to nobody?. or.. lol wait.  Is there something I should be doing other than chown'ing to nobody? Or should I chown it to 
why chown at all? give write permissions to all. you want all users to be able to write to it, no?
Ok, I am unsure how to go about that. I know, simple question.  yes
man chmod

just curious, im building that system in a day or so and was considering ubuntu as my OS. probably the 8.04 beta until the official release

Now on my "good" laptop Encription Key is also off which connects to the WPA2 only AP.
other wifi chipset maybe.  how it worked before ?
it worked with all computers before with the WPA/WPA2 setting.
i see
Now I think my router somehow "hated" my MAC since the upgrade, and in the process when I rebooted the router maybe it reset itself..
you have broadcom ?
I did not want to disturb others, as for them the internet worked (only this one laptop was excluded)..  It is an "ADB" router, the ISP sent it.
no, i mean the wifi card
guys, how can I confirm that my remote server has an ubuntu-desktop running ?
what do you mean?
zyki have a remote server which I just have shell access to.  sorry, that post was for you ^^
"apt-cache policy ubuntu-desktop" to confirm the package is installed. then perhaps, "ps aux | grep X" to confirm Xorg is running?
I see nothing from grep
Hi
hey 
when ubuntu boots, it only sees 885megs of RAM but I have 1024. Any ideas why and how to fix that?
try adding mem=1024M to your grub kernel line.  that should tell the kernel that there is a full gig
i have: kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.8.1-4-386 root=/dev/hda2 mem=1024M ro quiet splash
humm.. very strange that doesnt work :(
and I rebooted and it still sees 885. it's bizaare
very.  what kind of computer is it?
thinkpad
ok.. shared memory graphics card perhaps?
maybe.  ie i dunno ;-)
does Windows find a gigabyte?
is there a way I can find out ?.  yes
the BIOS.. F1 i think after shutdown -> turn on. (my X21 only gives that option after it has been powered off)
what am i turning on ?
just look around and see if there is any mention of a like a shared amount or anything
ok.  i'll give that a try, thanks so much for your help..
maybe the opening, informal screen
k
or in on of the subscreens, as a setting
brb
why this for doesn't work in python --> for i in os.system("cat dictionary.txt"): s.send('VRFY ' + i + '\r\n')
for starters dont use os.system. use readlines
sorry i don't understand you
you want a function that will read your text file and split each newline as an array element for your for loop
yes.  but this isn't the same than for i in `cat dictionary.txt` in bash ?
ive been running apt-get auto clean thinking it was removing packages that the machine had no use having, not deleting all the packages ive downloaded.... :(

is there a sysprep-like utility for ubuntu?
"Linux doesn't have SIDs and it's not registered, so there's nothing to do to "prepare" it. Just copy the VM file. "
well, it's not quite that simple. when you install ubuntu, you have to give it a user name and their details, a hostname, and other things. if you blindly copy the VM file, that's a start, but you then need to go in and change all that stuff. I've never messed around with mass-deployments of ubuntu, so I am sure there must be a better way

hi, i'm not able to boot my fresh 10.04 server installation on lvm+raid. I get the busybox prompt and "/dev/mapper/LVM-root not found" message. any thoughts?
have you installed raid modules and lvm utils in this system?
i did a standard install with the 10.04 server cd. I used the installer to setup raid+lvm. no manual installation of anything.  i wasn't able to boot in the system after the installer completed.  by holding the shift key I got in the grub2 (1.98) menu, the configuration appears to be valid (insmod raid5, raid5rec, mdraid,lvm,ext2).  and my root partition (no separate boot) is ext4
hmm... this can be bug... but now I would try to boot from live cd, chroot into installed system, try to install raid and lvm utils, update initramfs and reboot
can I do that with the server cd? or do I need the desktop cd?
I think that server cd should bu sufficient
rescue mode?
try it... if it boot into terminal it will be good :)
it just doesn't seem to load raid+lvm in the terminal :(
hmm, md devices doesn't exist? :/
no
try modprobe raid1 (or raidX according to level...)
oh. there is md0
vgscan should map lvm devices
false positive, the md0 says "no such file or directory" (if i triy mdadm --start /dev/md0).  vgscan gives no output aparat from "this may take a while"
i only see s/pdif. something gone awwry. sSS
?
sSS , i checked and nothing is muted
I'm having trouble mounting a partition. I can't mount my windows boot partition; mount tells me it is mounted or the directory is busy
that usually means you already have it mounted under another directory. the filebrowser usually lists any mounted drives in the left pane of the filebrowser window
It is not mounted; it's not listed under mount
how are you mounting it?
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt.  I've tried mounting it to different folders
k, no problems there, the most common cause is an unclean windows shutdown. rebooting to windows and shutting it down again should fix that..  there might be something helpfull in dmesg, dmesg | tail to view the last few lines
Well that would be great and all if I could get it to show up in grub.  nothing in dmesg either
hi , how do i see if i have a .deb installed ? (not in repos btw)

*push* I assume nobody here will know this because nobody here un. I am trying to access a braille line, which always worked in earlier ubuntu versions. Now, when trying to access it, I get the error "usbfs: interface 1 claimed by usb-storage while 'brltty' sets config #1". I tried blacklisting and searched for udev options, but ... nothing seems to work like it did a few years ago, so I have no clue what to do.
does swapping the usb ports they use make any difference?
no
is there some other usb drive which didn't used to be there?
it loads the internal sdcard, and the keyboard from there. I tried to blacklist usbhid and usb_storage, but they are reloaded again though..  in the last ubuntu version, it worked.
is the sd card your boot drive?
no.
what happens if you insert the sd after the braille line has loaded?
if I remove the sdcard, I get the same error with usbhid..  instead of usb_storage
I'm not familiar with braille lines, is there any configuration for it to make it not care about needing configuration 1?
no. brltty cannot access the braille line for some reason.
do you have a brand and model for this braille line?
c251:1124
I can't seem to find any products using the id number of c251:1124. Could be a usb cable or controller giving corrupted data
http://mielke.cc/svn/main/brltty/Autostart/Windows/brltty.inf.  actually, the device is recognized.  it just seems that the other drivers "claim" it, so brltty (which uses libusb) cannot use it.
this looks like a bug in libusb, not so easy to correct..  is there any way for you to use a non-usb keyboard?
well, there is no /proc/bus/usb/, and I cannot create it ...
a non-usb keyboard could work around the hid problem
the braille line has an integrated sd-card and keyboard..  so this is not an option.
for some reason - in ubuntu on a dell mini 9, i cant get the F keys (which are actually fn+a/s/d/f/etc/) to work in any terminal, not xterm or gnome terminal

hmm. why http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Make_Startup_Disk_001.png - "Make startup disk" is disabled in my usb-creator ? ;/
select the partition on your usb stick
it doesn't helps. it is still disabled
is there enough space on your usb stick?
is there any way to create bootable usb ?.  yes it's 2G stick. any other way* ;-)
you need to select an appropriate ISO image, and then the partition on your usb stick, that should work
iso selected, partition also... button still disabled
then i don't know, sorry

you need to select the partition, not the drive - click on /dev/sdf1
sdf1 isnt a part of sdg drive.

- use awk to select the first column from the who output, put that through uniq and you get the unique users on the system
but if I use the "users" command will that not do the same thing?
users lists the current users laterally.  users lists the current users laterally.  I get two instaces of rich
so It's not the same thing... hmm we didn't see awk though nor did we see unique :/
who | awk '{print $1}' | uniq.  - just shows rich
users | awk '{print $1}' | uniq just shows  ;)
- i believe thats the desired result
so that still doesn't solve my question what the difference is :D.  between who and users :D
How to get rid of the 'mouse click' effect on icons on the toolbar in Hardy?
That is via Compiz... try installing 'sudo aptitude install simple-ccsm' and see if you see it.
have it isntalled, turned most off, and it still does for some reason, can't find the setting :| and the effect keeps glitching out and so ugly
I'm trying to figure out what plugin does it, but the plugin names aren't very logical

does anyone know if it's possible to get into a terminal during an ubuntu install?
what for ?
I have the ubuntu 11.04 server install can't find /media/cdrom issue
during the install it can't find /media/cdrom ?
yeah need to ln -s /cdrom /media/cdrom
don't think you do
it's a known bug
under what circumstacnces
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/726581
if it's a known bug can you give me the bug id.  perfect, thank you.  just alt F2/F3 keys to get a terminal
during the install?
pretty much as soon as the kernel has booted for the installer
cheers i'll try it
that should be enough time to get a terminal
looks all good - thanks for the help
nice job
hmmm, no fails again same thing.  if i ls /media/cdrom it sees the cd files.  could i use mnt or something?
sorry, I missed the question,
it failed - took longer than i thought - same thing, even though i'd linked cdrom to media/cdrom.  so instead of symlinking could i mount it there?
no
cool
do you anyone have a firefox 3.5?
yes we do some of us

have*. xD
jjust go to about window in ff and check what it says
i have a 3.0.14 mozilla
http://paste.ubuntu.com/18871/. Does anyone know why that happens?. It ignores alot of the servers.... Anyone know why my Ubuntu install refuses to acknowledge that there's a .19 kernel out there? It just doesn't see it. Nothing in Synaptic, nothing with update manager.. Yet my update manager when run from the terminal says the distro isn't avaliable in the meta-release list.
19 is only aviable in proposed and not recomended for general public- proposed is a dangerous repo to enable is for beta testing and can and will brake your system.  las aviable kernel on normal repos is 18
Well the general public releases can and do break my system, so it can't be much worse..  I haven't been able to successfully run any kernel past .16.
hi I am trying to install a Theme. And it says in the INSTALL file that Choose the window decoratos. 1.Choose the controls LiNsta2. 2.Choose the window decoratos LiNsta2. I did #1, but how do we do #2 ?
look at the details tab in the theme dialogue
I clicked on Theme Details. I only see Controls, Icons tab
there should be a window border and an icon tab there
All I see is Controls, Icons tabs
odd. I have the three I described ( this is in gnome on 6.06 )
same here I got latest ubuntu build.  I wonder why I dono't have the window tab :S.  problem after problem
does the window border tab show on other themes?
no
hmm - dunno then - sounds like the theme function is broken for some reason
:s I don't know how to fix it
hang on a second.  try sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-control-center
okay
hi, anyone has any experience connecting to internet trough motorola v3xx? Tutorial links appreciated, tnx

hi. when I use mozplugger in midori (and other browsers), opening pdf files, I notice a strange behaviour about input events. If I use arrow keys on keyboard, they don't work, but if I use the mouse wheel scrolling, it works, instead. How could I fix the issue for embedded pdf files with this plugin?. Any ideas?
wouldn't that be a question for mozplugger?
how could I fix the issue?
I running php with fpm and I want to recompile php5 deb packages with a new prefix in order to allow zend server installation. How do I do this.
that's a reasonable ammount of effort
yeah and it's giving me a lot of headache
I have a silly question, why do you need to recompile it to work with zend ?
I'm running php with fpm and zend server doesn't support fpm.  so my php5 install crashes everytime because of this
ok, so I have a solution you may find easier, but also sloppier.  how "professional" do you want to be I guess it depends on the purpose of this machine)
the purpose of the machine is a build server
ok - this "may" be acceptable to you
running jenkins, subversion, java, python
have you considered building a php install in /opt (for example) to run zend again. keep it totally isolated from your machine machine. sorry, main file system
yeah I'm considering it, but how to modify the php5 source files is my concern
why do you need to mofidy the php source files ?.  sorry if I missed that in the explination
i want to prefix the compilation with --prefix
you don't modify the source for that
i want to prefix the compilation with --prefix /some-new-dir
that is a configure option.  eg: ./configure --preifx=/opt/php --sysconfdir=/opt/etc etc etc
don't I need php5 source first?
yes, you do
so which is easier. Prefixes my already working php5 install with some new location or installing zend server in a chrooted environment?
Does anyone have a clue how to run plasma in gnome? I've tried simply running the "plasma" command but it crashes. It works in KDE session though.
Is it plasma a qt application?
Yeah.  plasma is the core of kde desktop :p
Maybe you should install the qt frameqork for it to work with gnome, which is gtk?
package name?
just a second
ok
anyone good with remote connections?
sorry, i was attending some customers. I never accessed via VNC, you must likely need to enable the VNC server in ubuntu first
I did that 
on the other hand i wouldn't recommend you running VNC, the protocl sucks, I would try x2Go instead!
I need to access from a windows pc
no prob with that, x2Go is a multi-platform client and server solution, similar than VNC but better
Can I use it on smarthphones as well? Android, iOS...
what's exactly the error you are getting?
no security types supported. Sever sent security types but we do not support any of their
what about using other VNC client? Still, I highly recommend you X2Go
Ive tried it with uvnc as well
and forget about VNC for ever
its not the viewer that is the problem, it must be some setting in ubuntu. I'm using the pre installed package
I'm not on ubuntu right nowm can't check any of the server settings
why is X2Go better?
hi. i have a small question
go ahead...
im tryin to get to irc.rizon.net/6667 but it keeps failing why?
Hi folks, super basic question here. Are there alternative themes for Unity? I hate Orange. :-). Also purple. Purple is cute but dangit.
you mean the spash?
I know I can change the wallpaper and the dash color changes which is pretty slick.  main thing I want to do is use a theme other than ambiance or radiance.  I've enabled Adwaita using gnome tweak tool but it doesn't quite work right and I've found a lot of other themes arent quite proper. It seems like a theme has to have very specific properties to be compatible with the Unity desktop
I'm not sure about extra themes I was looking at the web yesterday about this and found links like this with ppa's not sure really. http://www.redmondpie.com/4-beautiful-ubuntu-unity-themes-complete-with-how-to-download-and-install/
interesting.  wonder if those will work in 12.04
how do u decrypt protected files from itunes music store...or can u
that would be illegal  i believe
lunar_lamp whats the diff between doing that and burning the protected file onto a cd, then burning it back onto itunes as a .mp3 ??
- you are allowed a certain number of transfers onto cd etc. you will not be able to burn the file into mp3 legally from the cd. you can transfer it a certain number of times, but it is limited iirc
wtf?? there was no limitation last tiem i checked
hmm, perhaps im totally wrong zeus...
since when are u limited to how many cd's u can burn on itunes
quick question, one guy in my office change his password and now dont remember what was and cannot connect again. i connect with recovery mode to the terminal as root and look in passwd but there seems that dont show the passwords. any idea?

yep. i connect with recovery mode to the terminal as root and look in passwd but there seems that dont show the passwords. any idea?
Hi, how do I install x86 package on x64 system? I need libSM.so.6 but when I run dpkg -S libSM.so.6 all I get are x64 packages.
why do you want to do this ?.  I'm asking as it doesn't work as you think it will
I'm trying to install x86 version of qt5 (from the official website)
!ipod. No. apparently. :P
you not making the jump?
Hmm?
is there an easy way to turn off upstart services from booting?. a quick google just gave me links saying o just comment out files under /etc/init.d. but that sounds daft
upstart scripts are in /etc/init/ the old sysv ones are in the init.d and other rc# dirs
regardless, whats the "right" way to disable em?
for an upstart service you could rename its /etc/init/servicename.conf to be servicename.dontrun or edit its contents and tell it to not load
but I still want it to run if I call "service foo start"
this is odd...i never had this problem before.....i got the nvidia drivers and correct resolution so im stumped
is nautilus running, or something else that will manage your desktop?
i dont believe so
any ideas on where i can get information on installing my creative webcam nx pro?
google for whether or not its supported by linux
thanks for your help, 
no xorg package.. that's not right is it?? someone?
no, that's not right, if you're looking in synaptic, you're running xorg ;)
yeah.. xorg is running, but i don't want to reboot to find that it's actually gone and what i am running is just the hoary version in ram
ah..  in a terminal, dpkg -l *xorg* ii at the beginning means that package is installed
hmm.. rc in front.. guess that means residual config and i should mark it for installation
what files are modified/created when I do "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chromium-daily" ? I want to remove a PPA

apt-get install linux-source-2.6.10 just made a bz2 file in /usr/src. should't it be unpacked automaticaly?

what makes bzcat?
Hello. Hello. I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 and I have an issue when it comes to boot/reboot. I have an Intel HD4000 and AMD Radeon 7730M (using propietary drivers). Whenever I reboot, it just goes to a black screen with underscore for a few minutes then goes back to login screen.
did you upgrade or clean install?
Clean install with the help of hachre
Ecryption: did it fail on you with the default drivers on setup?
No it didn't. I just wanted to use the proprietary drivers. After I rebooted, Unity wouldn't show up. After a lot of help it finally did. Now when I reboot, it doesn't reboot like it should.
how about trying the recovery from grub
It doesn't show grub at all.
you can hold shift after bios post boot. to enter grub
Yeah that's the problem, no BIOS post. It just stays on a black screen with underscore when I reboot so I can't do anything.
no bios post doesnt relate to ubuntu, you should at least see post msg boot on your machine right
Nothing like that.
did you recently added new hardware on your machine?
When I click reboot, it doesn't shutdown to reboot. There's just a black screeen with an underscore. It says like that for a few minutes then goes back to login screen.. Nope I haven't.
can you see ubuntu boot or not?
Nope I don't see it boot
try hold shift after you press power on your machine to enter grub, see what happens
I can't shutdown either. If I try to, it's just a blackscreen with an underscore
you can hold your power button until your machine halts right. then reboot
I can turn it off that way yes. But is that good for the system?
if you dont got any other options?
None, should I revert back to the default open source drivers?
i just told you what i suggest
You want me to reboot and hold Shift, what happens after I do that?
anyone happen to does be interested helping yoda?
you have an ubuntu-related question?
nah, not really. it was just my inner yoda emerging. I do have a gfx-card related problem, it's a bit hard to debug, and might be hardware failure too. When running opengl-stuff, sometimes X freezes completely. The info I can gather about that is "GPU at xxx has fallen off the bus" in kern.log, and NVRM Xid 16/8 in xorg.log. Sometimes also EQ Overflow.. oh forgot, also sometimes NVIDIA WAIT out of xorg.log. running 3.0.0, and nvidia proprietary 280.13 drivers, card's 295gtx. 3.0.0 kernel that is
Evening all. Can someone please give me some ideas for transporting SSH private keys? I want to disable password logins, but may need to login from various Linux/XP machines
shell script to move keys to an open location then a cron job on every machine that moves keys into place.  shared /home directories also.  rsync also.  is that enough options ?
I'm not sure what you mean there I'm sorry. Move keys to open location? My private key?
your prive machine should only stay on the client.  if thats your suggestion I suggest shared home dirs or rsync only
I need my private key to login from a host that is unknown to the server, right?
correct
So without setting up a new private key for that host, how can I safely transport my private key? Say I needed to login from an unfamiliar XP box. Or say, my dad's Linux box
shared home dir's from a central location
Could you give me an example? I'm not sure what you mean
you have all your machines mounting /home or the users home dir's on windows from a shared central samba/nfs server.  so when you login your home dir with your private key is preseted to every host in your home dir
Ah OK, but what if I'm logging in from a different physical location? Another office, etc?
you can still have remote home dir's if you set it up
Over what protocol/software?
over tcp ip networking and samba or nfs as I said
Having remote access to my home dir would pose a new problem.  I'm wondering how I can transport my key on my person. I don't want to open up my home dir (with my private key on it)
can anyone give me some help with mplayer it says it can't initialize my sound device (every other program with audio works)

What are the best PC-to-PC VoIP clients for Linux?
if im not mistaked, there's a Skype client for linux. mistaken*
Yeah, I tried it out...works ok, sound quality is awful in Linux for me for some reason
What is that?. Is anyone gettings this spam?
yes, I added myself to the sudoers file, but I'm still not able to do anything... do I need to reboot?
probably just close and reopen the terminal that you are in I don't think you have to reboot. But you might.
it still says " is not in the sudoers file. this incident will be reported."
wtf is with all the spam today.
how do i open a root terminal window? i bet i should be doing it from there
ahh yeah to add yourself to the sudoers file you would need root. reboot the system and select recovery mode from grubs list..  That should give a root terminal to fix things.
lads, what app can i use to multiply my terminals except terminator?
What do youy mean multiply terminals?
this: http://iceimg.com/hBUSFn1N/snapshot5.png
Like, I can still ping my server but I can't access the web pages.. when that service is on.
fail2ban will log what it is finding (by default, INFO level). You can look at the logs to find out what is going on.  alternatively, you can raise the log level to gather more information
it must have been because I tried logging in too many times? I mean I thought it was supposed to return an error if I do that. is that normal for fail2ban? Like to just not even respond with anything?. if I try too many attempts that is. What's the normal behaviour supposed to be?
which is the best way to get sound out of all 6 of my speakers? i'm using alsa with esd
Have you increased the wave suuround volume on your desktop?
which control is that? i can't find it. but the volume is up in the gnome volume manager anyway
right click on your volume control....  click on open volume control....  scroll through the alsa mixer and increase the wave surrond volume control.  that works for me in getting sound out of my 4.1 system
i still can't find that wave setting. i'm using an external soundcard. but i've got an internal too.  if we begin with the tabs. there are two tabs called USB audio class driver (oss mixer) and then two called Intel 82801DB-ICH (alsa mixer)
Any ideas?
you mean if you hit backspace at ~$ it prints g?
Yes.
right click in terminal window>edit current profile>compatibility and look at Backspace key generates section
ASCII Del
yes thats what mine is set at also. but when i hit backspace at prompt mine just beeps
that's what it used to do, but doesn't now.

where can I download the windows driver for ATI Technologies Inc SBx00 Azalia (Intel HDA)? I am running virtualbox to run windows but I cannot have audio in there
did you install the virtualbox guest additions?
I have no idea :(.  probably I didnt
boot windows under virtualbox and click devices -> install guest additions. and it'll install the drivers for your mouse, audio, network, etc
is it in control panel?
in the virtual box application itself, there is a menu bar at the top that says "Machine", "Devices", "help" once you have your guest operating system booted. You just click "Devices -> Install Guest Additions"
I installed it, but It didnt do anything, I think I need to get the audio driver because the card is not detected
Can anyone help me? I really don't understand how to set up my server so I can send mails with php.

can you send mail using the mail command?. i.e. from the command line?
I don't know. I've tried mail mymail@gmail.com and then just write something and ctrl-d. But I don't recieve anything

hey guys! I have a pretty old 12.04 installation that's been sitting for a while. is there any reason to believe running an apt-get upgrade now will cause trouble?
first set your system for LTS only. after that, it'll go to 14.04
i'm not interested in doing a dist-upgrade.  I just want the security updates for 12.04.  (but that was a good thing of you to mention anyway, because I want to upgrade to 14.04 on another computer :) )
dist-upgrade will update your *current* installation to 12.04.5.  do release-upgrade will bring you from 12.04 >>> 14.04
hm, i'm not sure I follow. but all I'm interested in is upgrading the suggested packages (around 100 or so of them). ah i see. either way, that's not what I want to do in this particular case. ah it appears as though dist-upgrade is actually safer than upgrade. I wasn't aware

Yes. OK. So Press Alt+F2 and type gksudo nautilus. Use with care, you will not be told when you are going to delete something that you aren't supposed to.
when am finished what do i type to end?
Just close the window (as you normally would).
thanks you i hated using terminal to do it
I had a problem recently with resizing an NTFS partition. there was some kind of small problem on the partition, but the installer wouldn't tell me about it - the resize just didn't 'take'.
it seems to work now ... I got an error saying ' Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)' but I can't really see anything wrong
ntfsresize told me in the end that I should do a "chkdsk/f" to fix it, and then it was fine..  well, if it works....  by the way, version 1.4 is available noww - I updated that forums post for the new version.
ive had no issues wuth Pulse Audio. :)
Pretty much most of what PulseAudio can do, ALSA already does without the need of wasting CPU cycles re-mixing sounds.
never figured out how to get alsa to play sounds out of the pc in the living room from here. :P
Heh, sheash...  NFS man! NFS! :p.  Actually depends on why exactly you'd want to.

the bash man page is a good start, as is 'learning the bash shell', from O'reilly

howdy. I'm having a problem listening to my music cd's on ubuntu.. I know its not the speakers, i can hear sound when I play sounds that are locally on the hard drive.. or the volume either.
what application are you using to play CDs?.  also, warty or hoary?
4.10, tried xmms and cd player.. when i try to open up the cd in nautilus, i receive this error message:. mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdd,. or too many mounted file systems
more than likely it's a volume slider that needs to be unmuted.  you don't "mount" audio CDs
i have no probs with data cd's on the cd dirve.
In the Volume Control, are you using the ALSA mixer or the OSS mixer?
sorry, but how would i find that out.

I've a .bz file for libgcrypt. But if I install it by hand.. without using Apt will it break anything?. Or have two differnet version of libgcrypt installed?. Anyone? :P
is there a PPA for it?
Dont know.. dont think so
do you have the source for the software that needs it or is it pre-compiled?
Its on launchpad.. but doesnt seem like there is a PPA. Got the sourvce. But the system hsa a earlier version installed, and removing it will break a LOT of stuff
I would suggest making sure that, when you install it, that it goes to /usr/local or /opt instead of /usr
well it should go into /local by default..
guys how do i change the number of spaces for a tab from 8 to 4 in the terminal?

no idea.
its a gaming mouse, not really standard. since it operates at 2000 dpi
thats probably part of the prob... i've got a cheap best buy brand 2 buttons and wheel mouse.. 12 bucks, works fine..  are you sure you edited your menu correctly, so it will work when you reboot?
im gonna reboot now and see

Hey, I cant use the internet after a few minutes of using the Transmission torrent client. Can anyone help me?
maybe Transmission is using all your bandwidht, try closing it and refreshing your IP address
Well, Transmission wont download ether, and after I close it my net still doesn't work. How do I refresh my IP?
@ which type of internet do you have?
DSL 512kbps

Launching avast! Antivirus after I tried updating it, I'm getting this message: "An error occured in avast! engine: Invalid argument" -- any tips/suggestions?
"tried" updating it? Do you mean to imply the update was unsuccessful?
:) Well I can't say either way. I hit the button to, "Update the database" (I assume in reference to the known viruses, etc.) and after that it's been giving me this dialog upon launch of the application.. So I can't say if it was/wasn't succesfful -- only that it 'broke' it.
have you tried reinstalling it? That would definitely fix the issue...it sounds like something got corrupt somewhere. I don't use Avast..  if you can reproduce the problem on a fresh reinstall there maybe something wrong with the package.. I wasn't aware avast supported linux natively...
Shame.. I was hoping to acvoid that. *shrug* Ah well. I'll reinstall. :) (Yeah, there's a Linux version)
not saying it's the only solution but I don't use Avast myself. And it would definitely be easier..  you're more than welcome to ask for other solutions. Just putting my two cents out there so at least somebody answers your question. :p.  why Avast on Linux anyway..? I'm not too worried about linux viruses myself...
Agreed. Reinstall is almost always easier. Just out of curiousity, what is your suggestion of Anti-Virus? (I really use it for Windows -> Linux -> Windows).  Ditto. I use it so I don't contribute to Windows viruses. :)

Does anyone know how I can run the Synaptic Package Manager in XCFE4? I tried running "sudo synaptic" from the console, and also added a launcher to my panel. neither works.
what errors do you get?
i get GTK errors when running from the console, and nothing when clicking the launcher
what does it say?
can I paste it in a message to you?
how long is it?
~15 lines
okay, a little more help is needed :) so I'm about to install ubuntu, I've got 1 partition with windows and all my stuff, and a clean one i made only for ubuntu. that's D:. unfortunately, the partition thingy in the install manager can only find my c: drive. How come, and what do I do?
go back to windows and delete D: then restart Ubuntu setup.  it will automatically use free space
but the thing is i dont want to mix up windows and linux on the same partition
it's your computer, some computers have that problem, i have that problem on windows but on ubuntu it sounds fine
well i figure i need different drivers. its never had problems when i run windows
or it could also be the sound card. it could also be pulseaudio though i doubt it, I suggest you check the forum or launchpad
anyone know how to change brightness settings on a laptop?

theres no slider
hey, how can I add a module to be loaded on startup without touching /etc/modules ? for blacklist I can just add a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-blabla.conf and add "blacklist blabla" to it but how can I do this for *loaddng* modules?
add: modprobe modulename in /etc/rc.local
okay, and also without touching any other file :D I want to do that scriptbased, i.e. add or remove a kernel module from loading, for blacklisting it's no problem but I dont want to fuzz around in /etc/modules with a script
without touching a file, how exactly do you intend to apply ANY setting, think about it.....  you can add the line: echo modulename >> /etc/modules in your script (assuming it runs as root)
yes, but how do I remove that line afterwards? that's my concern, adding would not be the problem :). or will blacklisting it override that?. i.e. I can leave it in /etc/modules and blacklist it at will?
could use something like: grep -v modulename /etc/modules > /tmp/modules; mv /tmp/modules /etc
ah, thanks :) didnt think of that
easiest way if you ask me
yes, but didnt think of grep's "Invert match" feature ;)
SING: if you want to backup/restore your system, use 'dd'
where do i do that command? command line?
SINGH: 'sudo dd if=input/file/like/your/harddisk/such/as/dev/sda3 of=/output/file/such/as/a/usbdisk/like/media/usbdisk/image. SINGH: and when you want to restore you just reverse it 'sudo dd if=/your/backup of=/your/harddisk'. SINGH: just remember when doing output file it needs to be a file and not a directory, like /media/usbdisk, do /media/usbdisk/imagefile. SINGH: no, you can backup your current PC or restore a backup you made with it..
i have no backups. and my xorg is messed up
SINGH: it should make a backup if you change it. SINGH: where is the xorg.conf stored again?
etc/x11/
SINGH: cd /etc/X11/ then ls. SINGH: copy it and go to www.pastecode.com and send me the link
sure
SINGH: cant you just dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?. SINGH: now that I come to think o fit

is there any backport for 14.04 that support lvm2 cache?. think i found one. https://launchpad.net/~sbv/+archive/ubuntu/lvm-backports
random PPA with package apparently never updated in two years... yeah, no.
i mean its for 14.04....
it's a random user's PPA
i mean i could prol update to 16.04..
perhaps you should if you want those new features. it's not just lvm, you need kernel support, dm-cache, etc... probably an avalanche of updates for 14.04.
may as well i guess
just remember, it's systemd.
yeah nothing that would be affected minus backup software prol. its just a home lab kvm box

Hello everyone :) Recently (just after the Kernel Update yesterday) My Wireless internet stopped working(I'm using Feisty on an Acer Travelmate 4310, Wireless card: Atheros AR5007EG). Yesterday under Restricted drivers it disappeared from that list to :( Does anyone know what to do? Someone told me to downgrade my kernel, but how do I do that? and is it safe? :
*downgrade i mean just install the previous kernel version
Okay :) How do I do that?
use synaptic or aptitude from terminal.  "sudo aptitude/synaptic"
Aboed: Is it safe?
what ? running aptitude ? sure
Aboed: In aptitude, what do I do? :). Aboed: I'm rather new at Linux :) I know some things but haven't played around with the kernel..
what u use before?
What do you mean?
any other help would be greatly appreciated

wahhh this tablet works sooo nice :). except for the special keys :P. I want to bind a modifier key <Shift> to some xinput device. is there a gnome program that does that?. like "manage input devices"?
sorry, no idea. never owned an xinput device
well.  you have a mouse? :D. or are you hardcore keyboard guy =)
i must admit here, that i have in fact, from time to time, used a 'mouse'
do "xinput list" ;D
lol, ok.... so what exactly do you mean by 'bind' the shift key to the device?
well.  I have this drawing tablet.  and it has "special keys".  one of those keys I want ot make act like a shift key
ohhhhhhhhhhhh
it's a key, basically, I can press and release it, X11 sees it, too, so basically no problem. I knowhow to do it on the cmdline. I just wondered if there is a GUI program by now that does that
are you using gnome?
yes.  jaunty

whoops, accidentally fucked up one of my WM's, was gonna remove old kernels from /lib/modules, removed in /boot instead... should grub update fix it?
Depending on what there is left to work with - ' sudo apt -f install ' might fix . (Going behind the package manager's back with arbitrary rm's is not good )
the reason for deleting directly was because the disk was full. so apt/dpkg didnt work. it does now however
K; in those situations it is dpkg to the rescue -m operates at a lower level . for now . what results ' with apt -f install ' ?
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
No errors .. great // and we have operating head room ' df -h ' .
yes  freed up some
Then try ' sudo apt autoremove '. See if that gets ya down to 2 kernels .
did not remove current kernel ofc, just older ones. 4.4.0-6* and 4.4.0-7*. down to two  just curious if I fucked up /boot or grub with my "fix". guess I'll find out at reboot
Looking good ? . pastebin ' dpkg -l | grep | linux- " see if there is more to do . // booting kernel still there ' uname -r ' ?
there is sure enough more to to . https://pastebin.com/AWxKTSB1. currently on 4.4.0-81
Looks pretty good . but the latest installed kernel is -83 , Should be booting -83 . Lets nect remove the cruft . run ' dpkg -l | awk '/^rc/{print $2}' | xargs sudo dpkg -P ' . to remove the "rc" marked files .
thank you  that got me some more free space
What is now set to boot ' ls -al /vmlinuz* /initrd.img* ' on a pastebin .
I would say it looks fine now? https://pastebin.com/JyxXXGvS
Not made up my mind yet what to do here " /initrd.img.old -> boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-83-generic " Should should be -81. Does it exist '.  ^ ' ls -al boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-81-generic ' if it exists we fix that symlink .
ls: cannot access 'boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-81-generic': No such file or directory
hey all.. Quick Q: in your opinion, what is the best torrent download client for Ubuntu?
Utorrent :p
i see most have web gui's, but which one can support downloading via RSS feeds?. i use utorrent for windows, and have done for years!
oh! i meant Transmission :P
rss feeds supported??  ?
idk
wow.. am i REALLY speaking with ?? lol

perhaps if we knew what the error is (use the pastebin)
the error is rt2860-source: Depends: debhelper (>= 7) but it is not going to be installed. I believe my debhelper is not recent enough?
ffs iv done all this and still same error, grrrr

i want to change my GDM theme in Lucid, is that possible?
theme support has changed drastically from Hardry to Lucid
so its not possible to do that
u can.. but don't expect much support yet..
how can i
System>Preferences>Apperance.  that's how i change it..
i meant GDM theme, the login manager...
they removed alot of that from the lucid build
too bad
i know, i loved that customization...  i had found something online about how to modify it, made my OS not want to boot, so i sugguest not doing that
thanks.  i had enough of reinstalling, dont wanna do that again
lucid don't wannna let u customize it like u could before.. but u still have a certain lvl..
whats that
i've made custom graphics for toolbars and window backgrounds.. been workin on new scrips for window borders, but that's more of a hobby for me, nothing offically supported
id love that, is their a way i can have you as a friend on this channel?
I can see all of the networks, and I was even able to connect for a very short time (20 sec), but it won't associate with any access points. it will connect ad hoc just fine
intel 2100 is the ipw2100 module which should load and take off with out a hitch. make sure his wifi switch is on
it wouldn't be able to connect ad hoc if it wasn't on. everything appears to be working fine, except it won't connect to anything
Is it normal for a laptop to show this on boot up (terminal stopped working [i.e. /usr/bin/bash/screen] after a reboot this happens]) http://cl.ly/5ayC
nope, taht's not normal.
what could hav caused it? no upgrades, no recent changes really that i can think of
pigphish: ocropus
ocropus? embeds
ocropus is and OCR library
boID: this may not be relevant, but I've just been thru minor hell with 8.10 and a vulnerability with exim4. Because 8.10 is so old (and therefore unsupported) it was impossible to get a security fix. If you're planning to run exim4 -- don't!
You did not finish your question
sorry, I probably didn't state my case very succinctly. What do you need to know?
can anyone help me set up an apche server on xubuntu no one on that channel can help me
that's no different from doing it in kde or gnome.  asuming you mean apache.  did you try sudo aptitude install apache2 && sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start ?
sorry i mean Apache and i just put being xfce just in case. i installed it from the package manger
good. now sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start.  then point firefox to localhost
ok slo down please. slow
what part should be slower ?
i install Apache not apche2. apache2*
same procedure.  sudo /etc/init.d/apache start instead though
ok siad starting web server ... ok. so its done?
well.... Laptops are commonly used by me in university, home, work...... so I consider my powerbook max weight I'd accept

you running ubuntu on that g4pb?
and your audio wont work O_o. yes
is something is compiled for Intel (IA-32?) will it run on a 64 bit AMD?
I think so, but it won't use the full capabilities of 64 bit
and if I recompile, it will automatically take more advantage of the 64 bit, or would I have to set some flags or something or the configure code needs to detect etc...
adb worked here just easier to use windows for my needs though
we ran into drivers issues with windows
ah, it happens I did a couple of times with my Nexus 7
yeah, nice thing with Linux is that you don't get those drivers issues. you get nvidia driver issues instead :P
Heh, hang here another 5 min you will see them.
Hey, just a quick q, how do I start up dual screen on my laptop? I have a monitor plugged in but no image is appearing yet...
depends on the laptop if its possible or not.
I have done it under WinXP... but I know how troublesome laptops can be in linux. Anywhere I might be able to find out if it is possible?
what type of video chip does the laptop have?
I'm guessing a bit here, but I think its some SiS model.  its a Dell Inspiron 1000
Hi. I'm trying to install the latest version of empathy, but I am having trouble because I am inexperienced. One of the steps says to type "./autogen.sh --prefix=<your prefix>" in termal, but I don't know what to replace "<your prefix>" with. Help?
try /usr/local or /opt
okay, but how should i know which one to use?
it might be safer to use /opt, but /usr/local is in the path to look for commands by default
Okay I feel kind of silly now but, in which directory do I execute this command?
the one that autogen.sh is in
Okay, so I tried to run that command, and i said I needed gnome-common. so i downloaded and installed that from synaptic and tried again. this time i received some errors.
when i install amarok through synaptic package manager...how can i access it? by going to start menu ?. is it possible to add it toe hdesktop ?
is it in the menu? if not then try menu editor in preferencse to see if you can add it from there
ok. btw can i run wine to run starcraft ? i ran it fine on xp. with 196 ram
am I what?
did it prompt you for a passwork?.  er, pasword
yeah, and I typed it
did you use gksudo or just sudo?
haha I've been trying to get this damn internet radio station working for the past 5 hours. I typed gksudo
you know how to use vi?
nope. like I said, this is my 3rd day on any linux based OS.
ok, try sudo nano /etc/icecast2
ok.  the terminal changed all weird. what is it?
Howdy folks. Im having a weird issue with my network adapters. I am of intermediate *nix knowledge. Using Server 16.04. cli only. The box im using has two network adapters - one wired, one wireless. Either one of them works, if the other isnt configured (in /etc/network/interfaces). But if both are configured, something borks somewhere during networking service restart, or system reboot, and only the wired interface comes up. In t. the wpa_supplicant and the wireless interface can come up. but i have no idea why they wont use both load at the same time.. if anyone can help me figure this out, i'd be greatly appreciative.
I might be missing something, are you trying to route traffic to both at the same time?. just trying to figure out why both need to be active at the same time
- So. Thats the idea. For each adapter to be on seperate networks.. please dont yell at me if thats stupid and not possible.. Im working on a home lab network environment and Im using this box as a network services server (dhcp, ntp, tftp, etc). I'd like to use the wired adapter as access to that environment. And I want to use the wireless adapter on my home network so I can SSH in from my laptop and not have to use a console cable.
oh no worries. : ) We all had to start somewhere. guess how I know the answer to your question ; ) basically, its possible but not really recommended.
im basically looking for what seems to bea really complicated solution to laziness
ah ok, that I can get behind.. : )
im not so concerned abotu recommended, since its just a home lab and i dont care if anything blows up
idk what your running, but basically you'll want to setup a static route for specific interfaces. aka run 172.16.x.x over eth0 and 192.168.x.x over eth1
this has been an issue for a few days and at this point, ive completely worked around it and really just want to know for my own sanity why both adapters wont go up
have you set the /etc/network/interfaces file to static ip addresses?
Telex - thats the idea.. Yeah, so heres what happens. i have/etc/net/int configured with static addressing for both interfaces. but
what version are you running btw?
16.04. now lets say I have nboth interfaces configed and neither commented out. If i reboot, only the wired int comes up. If i reload the network service, it errors out.. my logfoo isnt great, but lookign at jouirnelctl, it appears that the wireless adapter errors with an exit code 1 and doesnt come up. but. if I comment out the wired int and reload, eveyrthing is peachy. same if I comment out the wireless.. so one at a time, they load up fine. its only when the config has both uncommented that stuff goes sideways
ok, can you do a pastebin of that config? (changing the ips respectively.... )
yeah. which configs do you want?. http://pastebin/com/Su6vGLhN. thats my /etc/net/int. except im using a wpa_conf wpa_supplicant location instead of hardcoded SSID and PSK. oh, and that pastebin shows them both on the same network, but they woudl be on seperate networks in the config i want. ok, and pardon me if Im being facetious here, but my issue isnt with connectivity or routing. Its that both adapters wont load at the same time.. i.e - ifconfig. so like, with each adapter uncommented in the config file, and a fresh boot fo the system, ifconfig shows that only the wired adapter loads.. i can then manually intiate the wpa_supplicant service and it will bring up the wireless adapter, but that wont persist through a service networking reload.. however. if I comment out either adapter and reboot, the other adapter loads just fine and connectivity works fine. which leads me to believe the the config in the /etc/net/int file is fine, cause either one works if the other is commented out. Its something to do with trying to load them both.
Totally understand, I might just overly simplifying here, but if your box isn't sure which routes to send packets, it'll favor the wired, but then it wiggs out once on the forced reload. Since the failover of 'prefer the wired, if I see a dupe route' is being over ridden. your going to need some static routes in either case, since after force enabling the wireless the box isn't sure which is the best route. idk if that makes sense, perhaps someone with greater eloquence can chime in here then. : )
oh, those are words i understand but dont know how to execute. im not used to OSes having routing tables, but i did recently learn of the command route which lists a routing table. (Im a windows guy by trade, and know my way around *nix but am not totally comfortable with the OS, obviously). but i get routing tables, as this whole exercise is to easily access the cisco lab environment im working with
tl;dr  your going to need to put your cisco lab enviroment on a different subnet. Thats going to solve your problem. : )
this is actually somthing that confused me as I just recently learned about the route command in *nix, after being very confused as to why the ifconfig didnt who each adapters default gateway. No. i can post a /etc/net/int config with them in different networks if youd prefer. but the issue persists regardless of what network the interfaces are configured with. that particular pastebin just happens to show them in the same network. i would be more than happy to config them on different networks and provide logs

oh thanks 
sure thing
i have been a fedora user and i am one of the developers for some up stream projects. I was just thinking whether could i move to Ubuntu ? Just would like to know whether Ubuntu would suit the purpose ?
sorry, not sure I understand your question?
for example i might play with busybox too so can i do all those in Ubuntu as well ? coz i read that Ubuntu is used only by people who are new to Linux and computers
I believe you can run busybox. Ubuntu is for both beginners and experienced users
i play with kernel and also compile lot of other software so just wanted to know whether i could do those stuff
I believe you can, yes.
trituim: how can i look to that file?
try "less /var/log/Xorg.0.log"
type that in the console right?
yes
no such file or directory
I'm having some trouble installing Xubuntu on a second hard drive from my existing Linux install, could someone point me in the right direction?

can you please help. got the following message dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.. can you help
did you try to run this command to correct the problem ?
what command
the one it gave you .. 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
yes iItried but did't work
R U sure U added 'sudo' at the start ? ' sudo dpkg --configure -a '
yes I did
what did you try to install to get this message?
Thanks Mahmoud 85 forgot the sudo Now it works
If anyone is good at iptables can you please take a look at this pastebin http://pastebin.com/nZt7eZXM . I have just recently started learning about iptables but wanted to set up a linux router + firewall, but i dont want to have huge holes open.
just so you know your echo at the end is ech0
:D ty i must have miss typed it when i put it in paste bin was copying from my notepad lol.  does it look right tho?
What is this supposed to be doing? iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -i ! eth1 -j ACCEPT
if its a new connection thats not from the interface eth1 to accept
Just making sure. I assume this is in case you have more than 2 nics. It doesn't look wrong to me... but it is not my area.
because in my example eth1 is the internet while eth0 is the lan
^
yes there is two nic's because you have to be able to have one connected to the modem while one is connected to a switch
Just making sure. I assume this is in case you have more than 2 nics.. eg 3+
nope just 2 its for a small office
otherwise you should just specify eth0. because if there are three nics it will try and forward it. whatever "it" is
ok. :D i found a iptables irc ty for your help tho. did you forget your password?
how do i close packet manager windowS?. package. manager
are there any package manager windows open ?

i dont know what is going on at your end, it resolves to that address 91.189.88.45 91.189.88.46 91.189.88.31
mine is still looking for 63.149.98.50 for some reason
clear your dns cache ?
it's still looking for 63.149.98.50.  I ran sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean start
paste your /etc/resolv.conf and nsswitch.conf please
fuck, I know what that IP was, it was a bad proxy server I had setup
watch the language..
sorry.  well, I'm totally stupid, I had some proxy setup and forgot about it, sorry for wasting your time.  and thanks for the help anyway

Is it possible to automatically split audio tracks in K3B by certain intervals (every X seconds) or into a specific number of parts? I know it can be done in Brasero (for GNOME), but I can only find an option to split tracks manually with K3B, not automatically?
I'm curious. Why would you want to split at fixed intervals. They're unlikely to coincide with breaks in the audio?
it's for my car's audio player. The seek function is horrible (VERY slow.)
um, try wavbreaker (disclaimer: I've never used this myself)
so what I do is split automatically at every 60 seconds. If I want to continue where I left off (podcast episode, for example), I can just quickly skip to the track # I left off on..  is it a plugin for k3b or another application entirely?
sorry, it's a separate app. You did ask for a k3b feature....
I can use mp3splt-gtk to split the mp3 podcasts, but I was hoping K3B had a similar feature that Brasero has: auto-split tracks..  Brasero is acting really goofy for me. It doesn't seem to unmount discs when erasing them or when burning, and this has ruined some of my CDs.
brasero is incredibly buggy. Not sure why....
also, Brasero puts the FIRST 60 seconds as the LAST track, but the rest are in proper order. This seems like a bug that was overlooked.
well, I don't see any google hits for k3b and autosplit....
no problem, thanks for trying though.

Hey. I am getting a wrong fs type, bad option, superblock on /dev/sda1
and how/when did that happen?. Does your disk work if you boot from a live cd?
I was trying to copy things using basicley. its in digital ocean. I had 2TB of images there . (total 4tb) images were important. i checked fsck -N /dev/sda1
I don't know what basicley is and I'm not using digital ocean. What did fsck reply?
it says fsck.ext4 /dev/sda1. i wanted to pkill basicley it didnt work . so I restarted it. after restart everything is gone
try fsck -f /dev/sda1. !info basicley. This isn't an Ubuntu package, so it's not supported here. I don't know if anyone knows about it. Does fsck report any errors?. (fsck -f)
basicley is not the problem here.. btw fsck -f is checking inodes block and sizes
If something affects initramfs, it may be a problem. If not, possibly not.. ...or the disk in general
recovering the images are my priority.  is fsck -f supposed to take a while ?

Hey guys.... I used automatix to install the nvidia drivers this morning. Is that a no no considering the driver security problem that has arisen?. or does automatix install the nv drivers?
the binary drivers are included in Restricted.  and using "nvidia" instead of "nv" is an "it's your funeral" type of thing
Is there a way to check which one I have installed?
which is installed, or which you are using?
I don't know which one automatix2 installed for me.

Hello, On my main desktop I have two users, my wife and I. I use Awesome as my window manager and my wife uses Gnome. Back when we both ran Gnome switching users while leaving the other logged in was not a issue thanks to the user switcher panel applet. Is there a way for my wife to log into her gnome session while leaving my Awesome session active? I run a lot of applications and hate coming back to my computer only to find out she. has Ctrl+Alt+Backspace me out so she can check her email. Thanks!
there's a way to run one sesson on one X and another on a different X session.. at the same time.. like :0 & :1 but I don't know how to set it up...  you'd switch with ctrl+alt+F7-9
Tried that but it wont let me startx
there's a special way of doing it. kinda like running x over ssh..
That sounds a bit complicated, especially for my wife :)

As I said. If you have router, then there is an option in your router setting with wich you can auto updated to dyndns. Do you have router?
yes, what would the setting be?
Hold on ofr one sec.. for*.  Log in to your router as admin then go to TOOLS and then DYNAMIC DNS... enter your settings for your DynDns account and save settings on your router..  You have to klick on "enable" in "dynamic settings".
i don't have anything like that, what type of router do you have?

i'm building a shared library that doesn't build lib*.so.<n>, just lib*.so. how do I package it?
I think you'll have to create a symlink, but let me check.  since the main lib package usually follows the former naming convention, you could rename the library to match the naming syntax (where n is the ABI version).  also, check #ubuntu-packaging
I don't think this library has any ABI versioning per se -- I know it breaks compatibility on pretty much every minor version
is it frequently updated?
not lately
So I installed Ubuntu-server with xdm/fluxbox. System tries to start xdm at init phase, but the screen just flickers and returns, giving me only the opportunity to login to console, why's that ?
try running "startx" in the terminal and see what errors it puts out.
startx works, and it opens a terminal from which I can launch fluxbox
so your problem is getting xdm to work?
yep pretty much
If you try "sudo xdm" from terminal, is there any error message?
Nothing, the screen flickers and return.
No errors... Is there some sort of /var/log/xdm.log file?
there's X.org.0.log.  the X.org log doesn't contain any obviouis errors though.
Strange. I'm not sure what the matter is then.
Ok thanks anyway. By the way, since I never did get xdm to run, what's it suppose to show me anyway, a login-screen similar to gdm, or just a simple interface with a terminal like startx ?

Hello. Can someone tell me if ubuntu mate disable composition when running something on fullscreen like ubuntu lts does?. Sorry for my english.. I searched on google but I didn't find anything conclusive. I mean, I saw somewhere on the internet saying that unity automatically disables everything that can use gpu resources while rendering something on fullscreen.. But I don't know for sure if this behavior also happens on mate.
that's a compiz thing I believe, any compositor should be able to do it
hmm. I hope so. I would hate if I had to change to unity to have better fullscreen performance. :P
Ubuntu mate comes with compiz and Compton preinstalled, at least last time I tried
and ubuntu lts also use these guys?

hey, was wondering, i recently recorded a video podcast using the cheese software and was wondering how i might be able to encode it or save it as a mp4 or ogg file instead of the proprietary weird file format?. also, I noticed that i can change gstreamer-properties but wasn't sure how actually to go about that.... is that a terminal command that i need to use?. or is that something in my general settings stuff that i can find?. right now, its (cheese) is saving the video as a webm file.. i would need to save it as a more common video file, such as mp4 or avi even....
mencoder or ffmpeg can convert files
it will be able to convert cheese's own webm file format to something more common?
yes
how do i change gstreamer-properties?
not played with t, sorry
is that a terminal command thing?

Guys. I need a bit of help.. Anybody here?. sudo: can't open /etc/sudoers.d/README: Permission denied. That error message shows once I try sudo for anything.. even just typing sudo.. ..
well, what are the permissions of that directory, and /etc/sudoers?
How do I check ?
"ls -l".  ls -l /etc/sudoers
dr--r----- 2 root root 4096 2010-04-29 13:18 sudoers.d. It is not the sudoers file that is the problem, it's the sudoers.d folder that is..  I get dr--r----- 2 root root 4096 2010-04-29 13:18 sudoers.d
you don't have /etc/sudoers?
I do have /etc/sudoers ; but that file is not the problem..  For sudoers, I get -r--r----- 1 root root 609 2011-06-10 02:08 sudoers.  But for sudoers.d ; I get dr--r----- 2 root root 4096 2010-04-29 13:18 sudoers.d

This has probably been asked a million times before. I just upgraded to 11.10 and installed gnome-panel and gnome-session-fallback. I want to get back my application launcher though. Any ideas?
Are you talking about the Unity launcher?
nope. I don't want unity so I logged in using gnome 3
What "application launcher" are you talking about then?
But in gnome on 11.04 you could right click an app and click "Add to launcher".  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-p2DWfWd_Qk/SRmf52fljRI/AAAAAAAAAKo/V19Ilnv02Wg/s400/ubuntu-add-launcher.jpg See those icons and also the context menu on right click
sound update. i just recieved an email from a gentleman with the same sound card as me. and, I'm trying to now setup my sound. where is the asound.conf file in Ubuntu?
it doesn't use asound.conf afaik
could I simply create this file?
the default config should work fine.  erm - that's used with dmmix - which is already configured in breezy. *dmix
breezy?
5.10
is there anyway to directly edit that firl?. er. file*
what do you need to do?
there are lines of code, aparently, that this gentleman has produced that work with his wound. sound*. these need to be added to the asound.conf and the modules.conf
id he using ubuntu? And the same release as you?. 8is. bah
he's using 2.4, but I don't know what distro. but, it's the best lead I've had so far
I would avoid following his advice then.  what is the problem you have?
sound not detected. the hardware

Hi all
Hi 
I'm tempted to install the new 11.04 beta and then upgrade to the final on it's release day...or is it better to just wait for the final release to install?
truthfully, I would wait a couple of weeks after to install.
Really, a couple weeks? Why so?
Upgraded to 9.10 on a fairly powerful desktop (quad core cpu, 8G ram), there is now a +5 second delay when switching workspaces. Any idea why?
- do you use compiz?
Visual Effects is set to none right now, which I believe is compiz=off?
- did you set it to none?
It was set to none. I just tried to turn them on, but it said desktop effects could not be loaded, maybe I never installed compiz?
- make sure you have hardware drivers installed.. once thats installed.. reboot and install compiz settings from synaptic
ok will try, thanks.
some people are trying to get in box on ssh. http://pastebin.com/m484bf2e4 how can keep them of? can i allow login from certain ips?
an easy way is to change the port you run ssh on.  most automated attacks just try port 22
:) thank you for your advise. what port number should i use?
whichever you like :) 222 is easy to remember
is it hard to find with namap?. nmap*?. port scanning ?
how can I copy and paste to and from my CL (i'm on ubuntu server edition)?
pipe whatever to a file?.  and then inputit back into whatever you need with <
it removed the temp files when I cancelled.  for copying and pasting?
it's kind of awork around but it works if you don't have your mouse enabled in the terminal
I do have my mouse enabled
well all i had to do was to change the MHZ of my monitor. and it worked. however how can i keep it this way
where did you make the change?
it was one of the regular users (not root)
make your changes in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
how do i do that?
you edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
is that safe?. how would i do that?. im using gnome
Does anyone know why, on a reboot, my desktop is completely black? When I go into Appearances to change my desktop image, it changes back to my normal image, but my icons are gone. Anyone know why?. I can't access Nautilus, either?
I've been seeing problems with other things, but it may be related. I log into alt-f1, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop, killall gconfd-2, and then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
sure thing.  Do I need to log out first?
hello, there a room for songjuicer?. how do I rip mp3 from song juicer? I have to have all the steps I am new

pelo Songjuicer can do it
should i be using fakeroot to build kernel from source
You shouldn't need to use fakeroot (or real root) to build a linux kernel, though if you're building a debian source package of the kernel then you should use fakeroot or some other method of appearing to run as root to build the package as you sould for any debian source package.
i need to build kernel from source, that's all i know, debian is not preferred https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel
Ubuntu's source and binary pacakge formats are the debian source and binary package formats. Those instructions say to use fakeroot and they are correct.
then source=debian?.  ^
i have lost all my vurtal terminals even in recovery mode can anyone help ?

hi everyone, I have a locked-up movable disk partition for a while, having forgotten the password almost 1,5 years ago. could I maybe hope for some tools having been developed meanwhile to crack it? ehm, it'd been LUKS-encrypted.
such things designed with security in mind, i bet there are no fine solutions about it, but i'd try #hashcat channel to ask, if their rules are fine with it
<>.  their rules? you mean it depends on whether it is ok to help with it?
can anyone help me with my anti-virus problem?

go into powermanager and unset a parameter
i don't have the paramter anymore. i had it in the beta version but now with a fresh install i don't even have the on-battery tab on power settings
How can i tell what driver my wireless card is currently using?
lsmod will show which modules are loaded, ifconfig will show you the interfaces (wlan0) so make an educated guess.  dmesg | grep wlan0 would give you info (if wlan0) is your wifi interface
thanks i think i found it with nm-tool.  it says ath9k does that mean it's using backports driver?
not sure what you mean ... this is the atheros driver
ok thanks

what version of ubuntu you running?
14.10
is it up to date?
yes
genuine ubuntu, not some derivative?
nope, xubuntu. but i deleted most of xubuntu-desktop stuff and installed cinnamon, but problem emerged after i tried to add a repo manually through 'software and sources'
sounds like you're missing an update as a result of removing too much stuff. (in my opinion)
nope
hello

no
Hi I need some help with a dlink DWA-140 and ubuntu 10.04
is that internal or usb?
usb. it sees my wifi network. but will nto connect
yeah, i think its a ralink chipset, hang on
I did have MAC control and WPA but I turned those off. how do i check. its the one that virgin media dish out
do you ahve anything under system/admin/hardware drivers
does dlink have their own irc channel?
even if they did, its unlikely they support linux
let me check
:)
I dont see hardware drivers. I'm using server edition with gnome desktop installed
i was reading different stories on linux today and i came across this one http://decidere.blogspot.com/2006/09/cutting-off-windows.html how to i get the desktop at the end?

yeah, i asked in launchpad first, they seem a bit busy i guess. probably solving real launchpad problems ;p
heh..  you might try asking in #ubuntu-motu; I'd suggest asking if it's ok to ask first though
what is the ubuntu-motu channel for?
bazhang: Your slip is showing
hey, remember me :D?.  were you the one with a sony laptop?
Nope.  I have an HP laptop, you must be thinking of someone else
probably. some guy helped me out a lot with hibernation
Oh, that was me then. My hack happened to work on your machine too
the thing with telling the ACPI that it aint linux?
Yeah. Although it does that by default now in the kernel hardy has.  They claim to be Windows, iirc. They are aiming for bug for bug compatibility with that code path since it is the only one the BIOS writers test
Hi, I'm trying to compile an app and I need jack/jack.h. I have jackd installed so I was wondering, what package do I need to get jack.h ?
the jack-devel package could do
that doesn't exist in synaptic
something similar?
I've looking but I can't find it. been*
Does anyone know how I can make a boot script wait for a command to finish (insmod) before executing the next command (mount) without using sleep.
put them in a script after each other.  by default they will be run in order.. the next one starting when the previous one finishes
that doesnt work. I put insmod, then mount in the same file (/etc/rc.local) but the mount doesnt wait for the driver to be loaded and fails
perhaps the module is inserted but then the driver needs a little while before it can handle requests
my guess is insmod exits, but the driver still has to load itself fully
this is getting extremely annoying. In KDE, everytime i accidentally hit control-backspace, it kills KDE and I'm left with a beige background with just my cursor. anyone have this happen?
its ctrl alt backspace kills x
I know. X is still running,but KDE is dead.. i have to kill X with ctrl-alt-bksp
you mean gdm is starting back up its supposed to
after i kill the X server, yes.. but i keep hitting control-backspace
oh its not killing gdm
leaving me with a useless session until i restart X. no. gdm returns to the login sreen. screen
I installed ubuntu minimal then installed KDE. What do I do now for wi-fi
you could install wicd, or the network-manager app.. or configure wireless by hand
network-manager app/. ?.  network-manager-kde?
is it with the sh command?
agip: imagine that the file .run is named foo.run and is located in a directory. Then you have to do the following: open the terminal and write /path/to/directory/foo.run
sebas: like sudo sh /path/to/directory/foo.run?
agip: i don't remember if you have to use sh, try with and without and you don't have to use sudo necessarily
sebas: without the sudo and sh it didn't work
try without sudo and withoud sh. agip: if it doesn't work try with sudo and sh
sebas: ok it works with sudo sh. sebas: thanks m8
does anyone here us transmission bit torrent client?
what about it?
i want to get a newer version but i can only access 1.06 throught synaptic
you will either need to compile from source, or maybe find a newer deb on like getdeb.net
what is a deb?
if you ever used windows, you used installers to install a program. A deb is a file that installs the files for an application in the right place
oh k.  so i look for a transmission deb on getdeb.net?
wich version is better to have ?
i would test with the normal/latest ubuntu live dvd.
Ubuntu 13.04 will be supported for 9 months....
so?
Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS is a long-term support release..... nothing bad, just i want to know which one will be stable
and you can upgrade from 13.04 to 13.10 to 14.04 and so forth.  you want stable, even if it dosent support your newer hardware? or you want better support for latest gixzos?
well, i have used 12.04 without issue in my other desktop. but the only distro that was working in my laptop was mintlinux. i think that is an ubuntu based distro
What would make Dapper not mount flash drives automatically and how can it be fixed?
is your flash drive a USB drive?
yes
anyone knowsa why I can't compile a kernel anymore?
could you be more specific? What happens, what changed since last success, etc?
I made a distro update recently, and since I can't compile any kernel, with the same config as I always used
error?
well it compiles fine, but i get the error msg "Unable to mount root filesystem on unknown partition".  I know the current Ubuntu generic kernel uses sda as drive, but my custom kernels use hda... i tries both
tried passing it a root= ?
root=/dev/hda3.  also tried root=/dev/sda3
hmm, wireshark still only runs if I launch from terminal, is there any way to make 'export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0' work on wireshark from launcher?
can typically modify your .desktop files to launch with whatever params you need
Does that apply to the Launcher icon?
can go in a terminal and, sudo updatedb, then, locate whatever.desktop if you (probably wireshark.desktop).  yeah launchers typically come from .desktop entries as far as I know.  program called alacarte is helpful for modifying menu entries too most of the time... not using Unity here anymore so can't check
Okay cool, and on an unrelated note, how can I check to see what privileges I am letting wireshark run with?
hello all. I have a question hopefully someone can help me with. I recently installed ubuntu 8.10 on my usb stick using usb-creator. can I make the usb drive writable?
me too, that was awesome =D
yeah it went slick.  have you been able to write to the usb stick as ubuntu user?
i couldn't access the usb drive in itself, didn't investigate much though
it gets mounted as /cdrom. on my box
ah ok. i just needed something that installs ubuntu without a cd :) it worked :) :)
I have tried chmod but it hasn't worked. root has read/write and everyone elsee has read only

anyone use mt-daap or firefly?
I do
did you install it from the repo's?
yes
mine fails, it runs for like 2 seconds and tells me it can't add a file... i was trying to compile a nightly (or something newer) and i can't resolve the dependencies...
hrmm..well the repo version runs just fine, try that one and then edit the /etc/mt-daapd.conf file
i did, it runs for 2 secs and if i check my syslog it says it can't add 1 file. it seemingly "crashes" after that, as it's no longer running..  maybe i should run it without any music first?
that's the purpose of running the repo version, as dependencies are met
yes, that's why i tried the repo version first. i only tried to compile after it failed to run.
you try going to the admin gui via your browser? http://localhost:3689 ?
it's not there as mt-daap stops on that error.
did you edit the mt-daapd.conf file?
yessir. i think i should try running it w/o a music directory...
use /usr/sbin/userdel -r baduserbad
how can you delete users recursively?
... it doesn't delete recursively... learn to read man pages... it delets the users home directory
I guess you can't paste in a PM

I'm having some difficulty setting up my vsftpd server. I have the server installed and when I attempt to connect to it I am unable to log in as if it doesn't recognize my username and password
Check the logs.  /var/log/somethinssomething.log
it doesn't say why it just says FAIL LOGIN. I checked the logs before I asked the question
just clean ones :)). i don't even know what pdf reader i have on chrome :)). shame on me
chrome as a built-in PDF reader!
- thanks. makes me feel much better :D
@crimson: and when i do something like adduser echo "bill" that doesnt work cuz its still waiting on the adduser command to finish
because the syntax is wrong
oh :)
echo "$foo" | sudo adduser.  but keep in mind you'll want to pass flags to adduser, not just use it by itself.  the man page will help you with that.  else it will hang asking you for last name, first name, ...
@ and that will work for multiple questions, as it asks, for name, password (twice) etc

can someone help me resolve why I can unmute (and then monitor) my microphone but not record with it or use it with ekiga?. everything in alsamixer looks fine.
usb ?
no, PCI.
just using it in Ekiga ?
I just tried using it with sound recorder. it recorded nothing..  the microphone is turned all the way up and capture is permanetly turned on (I can't unset it)
you want to point your specific application to the location of the device
they're pointed to ALSA. There is no other ALSA device on the system.
does the mic/card work, have they been tested (hardware) ?
The microphone WORKS FOR MONITOR. That is, when I unmute it, I can hear myself immediatly through the speakers..  thus, the hardware must be functioning.
I have been using windows and I am wondering how to set ubuntu up in a. bootable CD.. I have the iso and nero installed on my computer

I get to a stage where the CD runs and runs bur never does anything, however I have booted off the CD thru Virtualbox and it works that way. I wanted to install it(the Cd) and thats where things get funny

Yes, I have verified it and run ubuntu from it. just wont install
you ran a live session and it works? 
yup
on an mac hardware?
yes intel
has anyone looked into installing ubuntu to a usb flash drive ?
yes
does it work just as if it were installed to a hard disk ?
Anyone had issues where the default gateway keeps defaulting to ath0 from eth0? Rather annoying :)
you mean in network-admin? Yeah, that program sucks. I don't touch it anymore
: that's about the only place I seem to be able to fix it.

Please report. and synpatic is closing. this is due to nokuntu package. please help.. how to remove that error and nokuntu? i need to install another software
try: http://pastebin.com/d95UWgeb. boom

its just gets the packages straightened out, helps things a fair bit
ok.  i copy pasted all those command in one .sh file and then run it with sudo but nothing happends. terminsal sits there
i don't really understand what to do with the prompt thingy after i type my username and pw

i just upgraded from 7.04 to 7.10 and now my epiphany browser does a segfault and refuses to start, how can i fix it?. there is no #epiphany

lol, so how do i actually remove apache2? i tried reinstalling, and then removing with apt-get --purge remove apache2, but its all still there....
do dpkg -l.  sorry, a sec
np
do dpkg '*apache*' | grep ^ii , that will show all the installed apache packages. You will need to remove apache2.2-common and the mpm version you are using to get rid of the rest of apache. apache2 package is a metapackage, it's like a list of packages to install
sorry mate, but i got this: dpkg: need an action option
heh dpkg -l '*apache*' | grep ^ii
im not familiar with that command, soz lol. ah yup that worked.  cool, so i just remove those packages that show up?
hi, I need a little help troubleshooting my wireless device, I installed the STA driver from the Additional Drivers panel but it doesn't show up in ifconfig. all I have in ifconfig is lo and eth0. the network "control panel" isn't much help, I don't see a way to add connections
does it show up with iwconfig?
and it only has the wired connection.  ahh let me check thx, one sec.  nope, still just lo and eth0. they both just say "no wireless extensions"
is the device a usb device?
nope, just the build in Broadcom Wifi card on my laptop.  I just installed 12.04 after a full wipe/reformat.  I was just on 11.10. it was working fine on 11.10
I think it just needs the firmware package
I would basically assume that it's close to working, maybe I just need to ifup?.  ok, what firmware package is that? do you know the name?
might if we knew what device it was
BCM4311
b43-fwcutter
ok i'll try that
sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter;
ok, so now that I have that package, what do I do?.  I'm wary of running anything other than the jockey install process.  last time I tried to do this without jockey I really royally screwed up my install
then maybe should reboot after the jockey in hopes that fixed it
yeah ok I guess I'll reboot once more, we'll see
hi should i stick to the GRUB bootloader or the Vista Bootloader
grub
any reason why?

hmm how come I am getting a request to update python-libtorrent to 0.14.6b-0ubuntu1?. when the repositorys are showing the latest version to be 0.14.5-2~jaunty~ppa1?. on the web

well I have the ppa that I needed to get deluge
well, that explains it, then :)
ok but I still cant find where its actually coming from
hey guys how can I make my home/documents home/pictures etc become home/dropbox/documents etc?
Make a folder in the dropbox folder and point what you want when adding to it.. adding to thiose folders
can you define better "point what you want when adding to it" ?
Sure if you have a save of a picture for example make sure it is going to the folder in dropbox.
well that would be great but I was looking for better integration. like if I opened /home/pictures it shows my files from dropbox's dropbox/photos
I'm not sure you can do else really, dropbox is a 3rd party so integration would be in the configs or a syslink maybe.
^ is what i want. i see
hi I have a Killer 1535 wifi card in my laptop and I cannot get it to work with ubuntu. I followed the instructions on the killer website. but one of the commands is generating an error. I would really appreciate it if someone could please help me out
what does lspci or lsusb say about that device?. the 8 digit hex number gives a clue about chipset
06:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 32). Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0cf3:e301 Atheros Communications, Inc.. Those are the outputs
At this moment, I'm on Ubuntu 12.10 using gnome-panel. I read gnome-panel isn't supported anymore in Gnome 3.8, which Ubuntu 13.04 is using. What will happen when I upgrade?
just installed gnome-panel and am using it now, ok, looks a bit like gnome2.  in the LightDM menu, it's called Fallback
So Ubuntu is still shipping it in 13.04? Awesome, thanks :) Upgrading tomorrow ^^
note: when I try to open a folder from the Fallback menu, it opens Totem mediapayer, so not Nautilus filemanager
What? O.o But I guess I can fix that somewhere... *sigh*

Hi there, wondering if anyone has run into this problem- tried to change login sound(using ubuntustudio 10.04) in /usr/share/sounds/ubuntustudio/stereo/ and now have no login sound. Tried to change back to default and still no login sound.
is the new log in sound an .ogg or .wav??
tried both file types. and changing back to the exact same default login sound config still doesn't work
ok check under system/preferences/ sound to be sure nothing is musted and also with alsamixer in the terminal.  they sould be .ogg files I believe.  i am also assuming you renamed the new file to the same name as the old one ...yes??
system/preferences/sound is fine and all other sounds play fine- just the login won't work anymore. tried renaming the file to the original- desktop-login.ogg and still doesn't work. odd thing is that reverting back to the original desktop-login.ogg file doesn't work anymore either
was this the drums one or the song one.  did you restart x to test or even reboot
song one. restarted x and rebooted several times- no luck
so it was the deskto-login.ogg ..yes?.  rather desktop-login.ogg
yes, desktop-login.ogg
let me find another sound here and test hold on
tried changing the setting in system/preferences/startup applications/Gnome login sound and no luck. Tried changing manually as root in /usr/share/sound/ubuntustudio/stereo and no luck either
um. are you using compression?
whatever is default. (for ubuntu)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

my install of 8.04 seems to be freezing at generating locales
sudo apt-get install locales . Are you using an 8.04 image provided by a VPS or something?.  oh, freezing. hrm, never mind, it's usually missing completely on them.
i'm using the alternate install because it's an older machine and can't handle the live install
are you sure it's freezing? Locale generation does tend to take a while on older computers.
- I was at about 6 hours
sebsebseb: it's freezing during the installation itself?. sebsebseb: sorry, mistab.  It's freezing during the installation itself, or during updates or something later?
- it's hanging at 1% at the "Configuring language-pack-en-base" stage. was at that point for 6 hours straight when I gave up
weird. Is it reproducible, or did it only happen the one time?
- i found a post about it, it seems to have problems when it gets to en_us.utf-8 (if i hit alt f4 to see what is going on).  - seems from what others have said it happens every time
how much memory does it have?
- over 200 megs i believe (it's been stored away a while so i forget the exact amount).  - this seems to be close to what's happening to me, although i'm trying to install not upgrade http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=865679
How do I change the permissions of an NTFS filesystem I just mounted with the mount command?
I don't think you can or should change the permissions of the files. That belongs to Windoze!. unless you're just using NTFS for linux,. in which case, why use NTFS...
I just want to be able to read the filesystem from Linux as a regular user
put it in /etc/fstab. with 'user' in the list of options
Will I have to reboot for that to take effect?

mplayer
what decoder does mplayer use then?. ffmpeg?
I thinks so, which one seems most comfortable for you (since you can use any of them)?

Normally it runs fine, but after a long while it starts to run very very slowly.. I don't know why.. My CPU usage for Xorg is 86% right now. steady. I don't know what the problem is :(. Anyone have any ideas?. I'm tired of restarting X all the time to fix it.. pretty soon I'm either gonna try to mess around with the versions or install a new distro
have you tried closing down everything you can apart from the X server?. get rid of the clock, all the system tray programs, terminals, and everything.. then 'strace' the naughty process into a file and see what it's doing
strace eh. I'll try it quick. Well, I just closed bittornado and it helped a bit

OK, "grub-install /dev/sda" then if that reports OK, do "update-grub"

for the "grub-install /dev/sda" you should have seen "Installation finished. No error reported.
no.. It just went to the next >
right, so we may have discovered a problem
nothing popped up saying it worked
let's investigate, this could be an indicator of why the install failed originally.

im using intel :S I tought that was the best choice for linux
- it should pick up intel network card no problem. But like you said, it is alpha

whats up everyone. i did a fresh install of Xubuntu14.04 ... but i have really low RAM 1GB ... and i was not asked to make a swap ... wasnt it suppose to ask me to do it ?
depends if you selected manual partitioning or not
no, just install
sure there's only one partition? "sudo parted -l | pastebinit"
do i need to redo the install ... or can i creat a swap now ?
depends how good your partitioning skills are :)
sudo apt-get upgrade. oops. 1 1049kB 79,0GB 79,0GB primary ext4 boot. 2 79,0GB 80,0GB 1062MB extended. 5 79,0GB 80,0GB 1062MB logical linux-swap(v1)
so you do have swap. also, don't paste here
but wasnt it supposed to be like 2GB ?
nope
yeah, i know if it a big paste ill get muted. so ... i do have a swap, and its the size of the disk ?
size of the RAM
oh right, another GB
type "free -m"
ok i did .. and ?
see how it says swap and RAM?
1 1049kB 79,0GB 79,0GB primary ext4 boot. 2 79,0GB 80,0GB 1062MB extended. 5 79,0GB 80,0GB 1062MB logical linux-swap(v1)
*facepalm* please stop pasting
lol ok sorry guys :/. but .. since i have only 1gb .. shouldnt i have a bigger swap to help RAM ?
i can. i can't seem to resolve an issue with apt. http://pastebin.com/d25d42a94. i received synaptic errors over and over, so i tried reinstalling the package, and now receive that error
what were the previous errors
similar 'sub process' errors. whenever finishing an apt-get upgrade. or installing any new package
what about update now
subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 139
sudo apt-get update <--paste.ubuntu.com with the errors
update retrieves package lists just fine. it seems to be an issue configuring the system post-installation of a package
so what is the problem exact errors to paste.ubuntu.com
the only package currently out of date is plasma-widget-networkmanagement, which continues to have problems so i ignore it
this is kde4.3rc?

any chance someone can answer this for me (learning stuff as I go and I'm stuck on this one); I registered a domain name, I added it as the reverse DNS thingy to my VPS' IP address. when I traceroute my VPS' IP-address it resolves to mydomainname.com but when I go to my domainname I'm not getting anywhere. Anyone that can point me in the right direction to look for the error?. (running ubuntu server btw...home this is the right channel :x)
when you ping the domain does it resolve correctly?
can't resolve hostname
what host are you using for your domain?
call me dumb but... you mean the hosting party where I rent my Virtual server?

Which graphics driver does the Ubuntu livecd use by default?
normal default drivers known to work on most hardware
is that what I asked?. (on Ati/Amd hardware)
I would say yes, but I take it you don't think that?
which has a specific meaning..  I didn't ask 'which class of drivers'.
dude who needs vim special for x. I just use vim in a shell anyway
yeah well i don't relegate myself to an ancient UI when using vim.  gvim has much better color support.  and gvim --remote works just fine from the shell
ok

Has no one had any random freezes on Dapper then? Lucky bunch!! ;)
nah. that thing is usually caused by buggy drivers. queuetue: is it totally random, no pattern?
But which drivers? I ugraded from breezy, and nothing was broken there. now dapper freezes every 30-40 minutes
I don't know. you need to suspect something and then see if it happens if you don't load that module. check /var/log/syslog to see if it suggests anything.  are you using closed source drivers?
well, thx  I imagine it's the ati stuff. seems to have lots of bug reports in launchpad. no, I use the xorg ati driver
apparently a semi-demi-hemi-quaver is impossible to play even on a percussion instrument

when you download a . *.tar.gz what comes next?
compiling but you should install only packages from repositories
it's an ok file .. but tell me steps please?
it can be very messy you have to install all the devel lib first and the compilers linkers etc.  you are better finding it on the repos or on getdeb
i see .. a webpage maybe?
uname -m sez i686 also in uname -a does this mean a deb i386 is inappropriate?
its appropriate. just not optimum.  both are 32bit systems, just different instruction sets. i386 programs will run on i686 but not the other way arround
Any thought why install should say "Error: Wrong architecture i386"?
anyone using easyubuntu?
no, I use automatix2
never heard of it?. is it as simple?

so I think compiz is a waste of time for me. Can I just uninstall it all, or does the standard gui/metacity rely on it?
why is it not working?. did you get ccsm?
no, it's fine. I just don't really have any desire for 3d effects and such..  mostly I just wanted to play around with it
it's easy to get running on your hardware, you were just given bad advice

hello, my sound works on my laptop if i plug in my headphones but it doesnt play through the speaks
open up volume control, check for the ispeaker switch and make sure it is set to on
i checked everything and all audio levels are at the top.  and un-muted
not the audio levels, you should be able to click on a tab that is called switches and the turn "ispeaker" on
i checked switchs but i dont see an option to turn on "ispeaker" . i checked the prefrences and i didnt see ispeaker there either.
oh ok, I thought it came default with every ubuntu

just enable routing and hit apply ok and then /etc/init.d/guidedog restart.  give your winders box an IP that is one greater than eth1 and a gateway that is the same as eth1

Hello Ubuntis! After I install apache with "apt-get install apache2" I always do "rm -v /etc/rc*.d/*apache*" because I dont want apache to start on startup. Is that the right way?
no, but it works.
so you would do it too?

How can I reinstall the nvidia drivers when I've installed a new (stock) kernel?
modprobe nvidia
that'll compile the drivers again?
no that'll tell us if it's available. or loaded
root@tails:~ # modprobe nvidia. FATAL: Module nvidia not found.. It's not ;)
okay...  do you still have the installer?
I wanted to do it the 'debian-way', but if that won't work I'll use the one from nvidia.com.  Isn't it apt-get'able ?
I believe so.  i believe os. so*
I don't remember if I used apt-get or the nvidia-installer when I setup that box. Now I just changed the kernel, and the module can't be found (like duh :P).
you could manually place the files where they belong..  do a 'locate nvidia' and copy everything from the old kernel dir, into the new one, and edit the config files it made.  but I'm really sorry, I dont have time right now, I've got a kernel I have to test and bug-fix. :-D. later all
.. nah, I'll try the installer from nivida.com first. :).  OK, well thank you for your time :)
details would help us.. im on my phone. so looking at 100 screen shots is rather hard

Hi, does anybody know a good OCR scanner software?
it's a weak spot for open source -- but try tesseract
I have just seen it, but i think it has no gui
that's right. gocr has a gui, I think -- but it's not as good recognition-wise (unless it's made progress in the last couple of years)
gocr is unreadable :(
what do you mean -- is the recognition insufficient?
p|.c |'dl l( un>Elc <lue cl ()ji\'rn CilT\Cl\liU o lllcln fl\ \|. that's it
14000 won't be frames per second, it will be frames per five seconds. which is sub-3000 fps
You were saying? :D
in any case, it doesn't matter what glxgears says -- if it shows you have glx working, great. but that's it..  i stand corrected
Thanks... will definatly look into it. Send response for gpm.. err... *second*
you can also do it with screen
Screen? Please elaborate.
i know theres a way to go back in forth from x to cli just cant remeber the commands
easy way is control alternate f1 to f6.  ctrl alt f7 will bring you back to the x session you were on
thats it...ty

hi, after installing lios (OCR program) my apt-get broke down and I can't install and uninstall anything. it says: lios package is going to be reinstalled, but package cannot be found. it displays it whenever I want to unstall or uninstall something using apt-get. any help will be appreciated
where is this package from?
it's from here: http://code.google.com/p/linux-intelligent-ocr-solution/downloads/list
what happened when you installed it? Presumably it was not successful?
jring: it didn't launch, because it wanted some dependencies, I've installed them, but then it stopped working. apt-get stopped working, because lios didn't run at all
pastebin what happens when you try to install it now
I can paste it here, but it's in Polish
prefix your command with LANGUAGE=C LANG=C (and use a pastebin)
it's something like: lios package is going to be reinstalled, but package cannot be found.  ok.  E: The package lios needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.
what command did you run
sorry, it was: sudo apt-get purge lios
pastebin what happens when you try to install it now
it's the same
what command did you run
oh, wait... when I'm trying to install it it says:.  Preparing to replace lios 1.7 (using Lios_1.7_all.deb) ....  sudo: update-desktop-database: command not found.  dpkg: warning: subprocess old pre-removal script returned error exit status 1
please use a pastebin in the future
dpkg: trying script from the new package instead ....  sudo: update-desktop-database: command not found.  dpkg: error processing Lios_1.7_all.deb (--install):.  subprocess new pre-removal script returned error exit status 1.  sudo: update-desktop-database: command not found.  I will
did you make sure to satisfy the dependencies? What are they?
yes, there were two of them, but now I can't use apt-get anymore
you can use "dpkg --purge --force-remove-reinstreq packagename" to remove it. Ideally you would read the removal and install scripts to make sure they don't leave junk you don't want around
thanks, I will give it a try.  it doesn't work
you need to pastebin what you typed and the full output
pastebin to imageshack or something?
paste.ubuntu.com

are tray icons hidden by default in ubuntu?
no
interesting, i've heard of some problems with tray icons showing up in unity, will have to investigate further
i am not missing any icons (steam, hplib, skype) so there is nothing hidden by default
http://ubuntu.sun.ac.za/wiki/index.php/Show_tray_icons_in_unity. maybe those applications whitelist themselves, or maybe i'm misunderstanding
ah ok, didnt know that, thanks for the link.  as you see skype and hp-systray are in there, because of that i am not missing them :)
looks like the answer to my own question is yes, also looks like skype is one of those that is whitelisted by default. i have an application that lives mostly in the tray, looks like i'll need to make it whitelist itself under unity
is there a way to install apt packages without an internet connection (on the machine that needs them)

hey,can someone tell me the command for upgrade from v.6.06 ?
zombunny in your update manager there is a button for upgrading at the top
there isnt. I made the updates,but im still on the same v.
sor, it makes it so much better once you get it right
I have it right, ubuntu has it wrong
sor, once you get it working* sorry
I set up my network settings, and they are erased after reboot.  I have it working, I just have to do it manually. I can't get it to auto-do wtf I need it to
sor, are you trying to connect to your home wireless?
No, I'm trying to get ubuntu to do that on startup. I can do it, ubuntu is having trouble it seems
i'm here for the same thing. there is a file you have to edit
What is your problem, maybe I can help
the bad part for me is that I CAN connect automatically.... but its to my neighbors. LOL
Ok, so I have a problem, my update manager dissappeared in the middle of upgrading, and it's still running. how do I kill it
Wait until it's done, hm?
It's disappeared, and I want to kill it and restart so I can moniter it
Try ALT+TABing to it? CTRL+ALT+(Directional Key) to another desktop?.  Bad idea.
it hasn
That may cause broken packages. Are you in the middle of a dist-upgrade?
yes
I've just installed warty, but it doesn't boot... grub gives me "error 18", anyone have any idea on what I can do ?
18 : Selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by BIOS
what can I do ?
that usually means that the disk is larger than your BIOS can handle, according to the documentation.  you could look for an update to your BIOS, use a smaller disk, or install on a partition closer to the beginning of the disk
this box had gentoo installed without problems.. i'm just testing ubuntu.. it's on the first partition.
which boot loader are you currently using?
grub. i just installed ubuntu. it didn't ask me anything. i'll see if it comes with lilo.
what were you using before?
lilo
you could try installing lilo, then
thanks, I will.

is there a way to tweak the dependencies of a package from the repos
No
that was fast are you sure
Absolutely positive. Unless you re-write the software to not use the packages it needs it's impossible.
well can i force 2 packages to install that would normally remove each other. for example gnome-games and same gnome
Well what package do you want to tweak (and what dependencies) ?
the same-gnome package was removed from the repos, i found it in the januty repos, but it wont insytall without removing gnome-games on lucid is there a way around this

If I type in a name of a command that's provided by a package that's not installed, I want to get the name of the package that provides that command. How do I get that to happen?
automatically? i am not sure thats possible. you can do it yourself of course w/ sudo apt-get install packagename..
uh, as shown here: https://jeremy.visser.name/2007/03/20/missing-command-suggestions-in-ubuntu/.  you type in the name of the command that's installed by another package, and you are told what you need to install to run it

Where can I find the configuration items for compiz. I've got Appearances -> Visual Effects set to extra. Where's the cube?
, goto Applications | Add/Remove Programs
ok.
The drop down the little drop down box and select "All available applications", and search 'compiz'.  Then install Advanced Desktop Effects Settings (ccsm).  Once it is finished installing, you can find it under System | Preferences | Advanced Desktop Effects Settings
oh wait. that's already there. - Advanced desktop settings. I think that used to be "custom" under appearances.
i don't see any play/pause/stop button bar on videos that play inside mozilla-mplayer (firefox v 3.6), is it normal?

Question : are there known issues with recent NetworkManager ? My 10.04 hang at boot, I disabled NFS entries from fstab (via bootcd) now system starts up with no networking. Manual ifconfig/route/resolv works fine though. Any hints ?

I made a system user and would like her/him to show up on graphic login.Possible?. not

im trying to install 10.10 on a brand new laptop. Downloaded it, burnt it to dvd, and ive put it in the laptop, changed boot device priority but it just won't boot, any suggestions please?
do any other bootable CDs/DVDs boot OK in that drive?
just going to try that now, i may just install an old version and upgrade, same thing right?
in theory, yes that's the same.  ymmv, and all that
hmm, 9.10 boots. ill install that, then is it best to just do an upgrade from the update manager or?
may want to try 10.04, since upgrading may not work as planned
how come?
too big of a version jump, IMO. It may work, I just don't like to skip releases.
dunno how ill do it, any reason it didnt work downloading and burning to dvd(10.10 i mean)
did you check the md5/sha1 sum of the DVD ISO?
yeah but the ubuntu site doesnt mention burning to dvd, only cd, so could that be the prob?
i used a live cd, but now how do i edit my menu.lst file if i'm not the root user of that file?

dont' recall

i an certain there was an ssh login despite the service never turned on
it was 13% 2 weeks ago
why are you worried about it?
concerned as a google search says that non-continguous whould never be over 1 - 2%
hello!. I have a 32 bit package, but a 64 bit Ubuntu. Can you typically instal these things? There's not a 64 bit variant of what I'mafter.
Yes, you might be able to..  Make sure "ia32-libs" is installed.
already installed....
Okay, then you should be able to install the package like normally
can't - says i386 error or something. Unless I do it via terminal... that was through software center
Hm... I'm not too sure.
trying terminal now.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/1174040/ bummer.
That's not really how you install a deb package, use "sudo gdebi something.deb"
oh. :(.  it's sort of always worked for me. *shrug*
(gdebi may not come by default, you should apt-get install it).  It works... When you already satisfied all the dependencies of the package.  Otherwise use gdebi
k, installing now.  it failed but I need to do an apt-get -f install... 726MB worth, yet my root partition is down to 500MB free. Nice.
Ouch :/
yep, I thought 15GB was enough for root. No idea where the space is coming from. I can onlya llocate about 7GB in use..  This package is uninstallable Cannot install 'gksu:i386' . WOOP!

Hi, is there anyway to revert my os back to 10.04 after a broken upgrade to 10.10?
no
really?
you can backup, and do a clean install. But why not try to fix the upgrade?
I guess I could do that. All I have is 10.04 LiveCD on a USB drive.
u mean i gotta find and manualy install drivers*crys*

I guess only for a few min I should be sweet.. ok it's runnig now
k, watch your ping, and watch for big spikes in etherape. if you see one, figure out where they're going from/to, then you can figure out if another user is pumping a lot of traffic

it seemed smaller to me

Oh the browns. LOL
i mean, i know i can change the theme, but it's problematic as the default. lol, yeah, i like them actually :-)
I thought the 'Lush' theme is pretty nice.
oh weird....  i just changed out of human and back to it... and i have my selection colours back

How to upgrade libc6 to 2.6, when the .deb says it conflicts with the package tzdata?
changing your libc6 will cause serious system breakage

tar x mnas extract, z means ungzip, v means b verbose , f means use a file (instead of a tape device)
well, he/she still needs to do the gz part first, not the .tar
Linux tar has gzip buildin, or you can gzip -cd <file> | tar xvf -
interesting (the stuff you learn in irc is amazing)
hence tar zxvf means unzip, extract, be verbose, this file

ok, I'll give it another try
Hi there. Spell checker doesn't seem to be working on my ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS. There's no read underline or something whenever i type wrong.. I forgot to mention. It's in Libre Office.
what locale are you using.  for spellcheck to work, make sure you have the hunspell packages for your locale installed
how to check it ? I think it's English(India) under Tool > Language > For Selection in Libreoffice
It doesnt seem like there are any hunspell packages for en-in
It's still not working after installing hunspell packages

awesome, cheers man.  do i just put that after the command?
yes
i just tried 'find / -name *.png | grep pid 2> /dev/null' and got error outputs. is that the correct syntax?

hey guys, im having problems setting up multiple gpus in ubuntu 15.10. comp only recognizes one or two, but i cant check the second gpu card temp. i have 4 gpus in all. 280x. amd. no not any crossfire, its a mining rig. 4 cards in their own pcie. no thats for bitcoin. there are currencies that still run based off gpu. so yeah just 4 cards. um. aticonfig --list-adapters. i tried that as well and it only displays one. at least i think thats what it displays. 08:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Tahiti XT [Radeon HD 7970/8970 OEM / R9 280X]. i would have 4 of these right. only one. would this be a hardware/mobo issue?
provide the output i asked for, install pastebinit and run "dmesg | pastebinit"
oh alright. http://paste.ubuntu.com/14255168/
which graphics driver are you using with the primary?
fglrx. proprietary. i have x.org but its not enabled
Hey can anyone help me with a problem i've got. i installed scim and set it as the default input method... now some apps dont start at all. like skype.. how do you fix it?

hi all. i keep getting a nodisk error in XP http://yfrog.com/12ubuntunodiskpx. does this mean that there's something with the disk drive?
it means you're in the wrong channel
(loaded in tray is ubuntu 9.04 i386 desktop. hehe, i'm afraid it's a hybrid problem hehe
the ubuntu cd follows the cd standard.. if xp can't read it either the cd or XP is broken
slart: thanks, i'll try another computer :)
I don't have linux-image, I have linux-generic. I can see the older versions on synaptic but I didn't find how to remove old versions. Any idea?
there is an option in ubuntu-tweak to auto-find and remove old versions of the kernel. after an update you might wanna keep one older version (presumably the last one) in case the new one has an issue on your machine
Yea, I just installed it. Leme take a look.
there is something wrong with my samba install. Firstly, it doesn't start up at boot up, and now, when i try to start it up manually via '/etc/init.d/samba start' i get '/usr/share/samba/panic-action: line 48: mail: command not found. /etc/init.d/samba: line 24: 10294 Aborted start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --oknodo --exec /usr/sbin/smbd -- -D. [fail]. '
type testparm /etc/samba/smb.conf
I now have a dump of my configurations
does it show any errors ?
none are listed
also you are starting it under root or using sudo right ?
uh...that was a test...you passed....  man i feel dumb, thanks heaps

hi all, I am running the linux client for a program called Firstclass. Everything works fine, but when I go to print from the application....no printer shows up here is a screen shot: http://tinypic.com/usermedia.php?uo=8a0tzok%2B9l6yIyL%2F%2FuY9yA%3D%3D Any ideas how to fix this?. I think it is supposed to use default printer....whihc is installed and working but doesn't show up here. Could it be that this particular app wants info from KDE and is not as Gnome friendly?
does 'sudo less /etc/cups/printers.conf' mention your printer?
<unconvertable>  hang on I will check. <unconvertable>  yes it does have my printer there
then it shouldn't matter whether the app is Gnome or KDE, but I'm not sure why it's not showing up
I have searched website of company.....but lets just say all they really seem to support is Windows....although they do have this linux client.
Does anyone understand the errors compiling the source? http://pastebin.ca/1263043
<unconvertable>  I was thinking maybe there is a configuration file?????
I just pointed you to it.
<unconvertable>  what do you mean?. <unconvertable>  I mean maybe there is a configuration file for the firstclass client specifically?. <unconvertable>  could it matter that it is a network printer...not directly connected to this pc
Hi. I've got a pcmcia flash card reader. When I put a card in syslog shows /dev/hde1 being created, but this doesn't get mounted on my desktop. Can I prod gnome into showing these automagically? I have everything relevant in gnome-volume-manager switched on. (Running hoary)
sudo /etc/init.d/dbus-1 restart
dbus restarted successfully, still no joy on the mounting front
the card can connect to the AP under xubuntu so hardware on both ends is good
have you attempted to statically compile your module into your running kernel?
~ didnt i already do that?
my cpu is amd_64,can I install Ubuntu of 32bit?
yes
thanks.. but many software can't be used on 64bit..
chris{} fire up a terminal pls.  fire up a terminal pls
Done.
now apt-get alsa-base
It's already the latest version.
oh right.. install alsa-utils from synaptic instead
It's already installed
ok..... another moment.  are u able to run alsaconf?
Yes
did it spit out anything?
When I first ran it?
no. this time
modinfo: could not find module snd. then it goes into the config.
then make the changes in the config that u think is necessary
like what =/
not really sure. had i known, we could have done this like 15 mins ago.. sorry man
Following card(s) are found on your system: hda-intel (the nVidia), legacy probe-legacy isa (non-pNp) chips. Last time I went with the nvidia, should I try the pnp this time just to see if it'll work?

Still nothing :(
turn it back then
back to the nvidia? done.

try sthing like /dev/hda1 /mnt/win ntfs nls=iso8859-1,ro,umask=0 0 0 in fstab.  but change hda1 to be your ntfs drive. and you probably want to change the mount point.  basically the first path is teh path of the device, teh second is the path of the directory you want to mount it to
ok so i put that full line in fstab under default?

can i simply add the repository from ubuntu 14.04 to my 16.04.3 install and install packages from 14.04 in a downgrade fashion. ?
No. Downgrading is explicitly not supported and will leave you with a completely broken system. If you want to downgrade then you need to re-install (which you can do while still preserving /home/).
ok so that link i posted mentions upgrading to later versions of a few sane related pacakges to resolve this issue. but i cannot find them on the debian site. any thoughts on how to get them. or how to address this scanner issue?
Ahh, I see you're just trying to downgrade a single package. That's still not supported, and still probably won't work, but less doom-and gloomy :).  To be clear, your scanner works in Ubuntu 14.04 but not on Ubuntu 16.04?
yup. well. mint 17.3. works in it
Doc: what is the HD size on that?. 160gb?
i think its a 120gb. WalMart Special
Doc: how much?
is it ok to help translating on launchpad ?
you mean in rosetta?
yup
i have isntalled kde in ubuntu and now when running kde, synaptic windows is with TOO BIG fonts, how can this be fixed?
in KDE you have to force using 96 DPI or it freaks out on some programs. To do this, go to System Settings, Common Appearance and Behavior, Application Appearance, Fonts. There should be a checkbox for 'Force DPI', and make sure it's 96.
i did but synpatic continues with BIG fonts

what-ho chaps. Blender 2.44 crashes with graphical glitches when I create a camera. #blender says upgrade to 2.45, which I did. It still crashes. Also the top menu shows through the top menu of the blender app (the network box etc) - should I disable... 3d desktop in gnome?? halpz!
If disabling 3d desktop works, do it. Compiz is still considered somewhat experimental, and it is not nearly as mature and stable as Metacity.
what is the cleanest way? I have ccsm installed
What is a good MP3 player for compatibility with Ubuntu and free formats like Ogg and FLAC?.  Go in your desktop effects menu and disable the desktop effects there. Your desktop will automatically revert to Metacity..  System -> Preferences -> Appearance, Desktop Effects
desktop effects menu brings up ccsm I think
Bring up the Visual Effects menu under Appearance.
aaah ok  that worked, I was using the advanced effects menu item
Now try Blender again and see if it's fixed.
oh noes. still crashes

hello guys. someone can explain to me how can i use the suid perms=
why do you need suid
cause i read some paper on the web and is a little bit "strange". for example if i understanding well, u can read some file with SU without the super user power. is a little bit strange how i explain that. but i think this is the thing
start at the beginning, what do you wish to accomplish
i'm not a beginner, for u a beginner try to study some hard things about file perms?
you're not making much sense
i just wanna study how linux use the perms for rwx. that's it
Hello everyone! I just barely installed 13.04, life is good, except that my wacom mouse has stopped clicking. I can use the pen, and I can move the mouse, but clicks don't do anything when using the mouse on the tablet. Any ideas?
Check your System Settings > Wacom Tablet
I did. all seems well there
Anyone planning on fixing the horrendously miserable Wacom tablet calibration program? After every 2nd tap, "Misclick detected, restarting..."
I don't see anything there related to the mouse though. only the pen, which seems to be fine
hi, does anyone know of an ubuntu package/project that will allow me to autocorrect blatant spelling mistakes in text?
it's because you can't... & can't install widgets wither :( giv'em time they'll sort it out
what do you mean?
hggdh: sorry did you mean i should use a usb stick as my root filesystem?. what i meant to ask was: can i use ubuntu server without installing on any disk other than a tmpfs/ramfs ?
#ubuntu-server is more appropriate for server discussions, but AFAIK you need to reboot after installing from the ubuntu server cd, so it's difficult to do it in ram
ah thanks 
You can press alt+ctrl+f2 and get a shell, but of course no services would be installed etc.  why, what prohibits you from installing even just on a file or on a vm?

hey all, i just came back to ubuntu after a few months and i'm currently having problems with repositories in ubuntu 11.10. i'm trying to install startupmanager yet it's saying that it's not available in the repository (in the terminal or the gui), even though it shows up in the gui software center. and i'm noticing it's happening for a LOT of stuff that shows up in the software center (like vlc)
are you definately typing the proper name?
yes, I'm doing sudo apt-get install startupmanager, and it says there are references to it but it says it's not available and has no install candidate. and it doesn't work in the software center either, even though it shows up when i search for it
not sure. does apt-cache search startupmanager show it
it doesn't show anything
im not sure. have you tried apt-get update first
I did, but now that you mention it it does say "W: Failed to fetch gzip:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_oneiric_universe_binary-amd64_Packages Hash Sum mismatch. ".  when I run apt-get update, i mean
try a different mirror maybe
i'm not quite sure how to try it with a different mirror

I will then use kernel module switching?
Sorry to bother: I have a Vaio laptop, but when I shoutdown, acpi_poweroff don't power it down. It's a PCG-FX505. Another thing I checked is that by rebooting (with any kernel version / any distribution), you can't get any Windows NT5.x+ version booting (I have to manually swith it off/on - rebooting Linux is fine). Poweroff with others distros is fine (ex. Slackware), but I think they poweroff my laptop with apm). Any hints?
i got a pcg-f707 where acpi never worked :(
I also think it's buggy, but Sony don't have a BIOS update. There's a way I can powerdown it with APM under Ubuntu (that ROCKS big time!)?
type: lsmod|grep apm.  in a terminal
Ogra: I don't have any APM module loaded :(
sudo modprobe spm
I got an error when modprobing :(
sudo modprobe apm
PA-A1-OC3MM. Opps.. FATAL: Error inserting apm (/lib/modules/2.6.8.1-2-386/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/apm.ko): No such device
how is you bios set up ?
Ogra: like all Phoneix custom Sony BIOSes, you just can't do nothing but boot order :(
i can set up several things for PM in mine
Ogra, no way. Anyway I can reboot to double check things.. but without changing anything, with a cute Slackware 10 install, I could swithoff the laptop with 'powerdown'.
i can select acpi on/off
Ogra, I reboot and check. Back later. UBUNTU ROCKS! FINNALLY A LINUX DISTRIBUTION THAT ROCKS!

Top link
i was asking myself why :))
on a custom build linux, I'm getting error <cannot execute /bin/sh: permission denied> on login screen, the only available user is "root", I can access the machine through SSH, any body have idea?
try "ls -l /bin/sh" and check the perms
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root
ls -l $(readlink -f /bin/sh)
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 871932 Dec 12 11:49 /bin/bash.bash.  what we really wanna do there?
hmm looks good
what?
we're trying to see the permissions of the file that's getting executed
one thing i wanna know, why I can access using SSH, but not machine own terminal
when you access via ssh you mean using the root account?. im not that clear on what you meant, thought you meant you can login as root, but from the user you get /bin/sh permission denied. even as root from the tty you just get a permission denied /bin/sh?
both ways I try to login as root, as it is the only user available now, but on machine I can't login, but I can login from other machine's terminal using SHH.  are you getting me, what I wanna say?
yeah.  what happens if from ssh you try "sudo login root" and try to login. or just "login root"
yeah now it has problem <unable to get valid context for root>. <cannot make/remove an entry for the specific session>
no idea, seems like some pam stuff, try asking in ##Linux
can you tell me, is it some thing related to permission of "sh". I want to figure out the difference of SSH and non-SSH way,
the permissions look fine.  it might be something related to pam authentication and stuff like that
pam authentication?? actually this is SELinux, any new idea?
Where is the system's default alacarte config in a 15.04?
there is no default alacarte anymore
How does it populate then?
use unitytweak or https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles
I've build a custom ubuntu with all my stuff in it, but when installing my home folders get flushed, meaninf all the alacarte settings are gone. i could back it up into my dotfiles-repo but yeah, would be neat to just tell the installation to use that file
"when installing my home folders get flushed" ... custom ubuntu ?
yeah I just installed all the packages i want into an ordinary ubuntu 15.04 installation and created a setup file with distroshare. now everytime i use that distro i get all the programs i want rom the beginning. *from
How do I unmount a drive?. I can't do it from the desktop as it says I need to be root
sudo umount /drive
it couldn't find anything on unmount in the manual which was odd
what do you mean? oh. it is called "umount", not "unmount" - if that was what you meant
doh, apologies =)
where is the loacation for the packages which are downloaded by apt-get in ubuntu?
You mean the cache?.  /var/cache/apt

use something that is not Unity
but I do like the global appmenu

you are on 12.04 ? did I read that right ?
yes
Does anyone use here the partclone or partimage software to backup or create an image of a linux system
i have used it, it works like a charm, but beware could you could be the unlucky one that has a problem with it, it worked on both my laptop and desktop
did you use it while running linux or you just boot to the live cd and create an image. I want to use it while im running my linux system.
i did it both ways, but the live CD nowadays is so much easier i just did it with the live CD, I boot up to the live CD, get a graphical interface, connect my USB drive, then fire up gparted.  i meant to say, fired up partimage
good u clarify the gparted from partimage.hehe. im a little bit confused there.. by the way have u try it in inside the linux system. or the command line.creating an image.
partimage has like a little somewhat GUI menu, it should be straight forward though, just make sure you know which partition is getting imaged and which partition is going to receive the back up, you dont want to mess those two up or youll have tragic consequences
I planning to try it inside my running linux machine. i thought i won't work creating a image in inside a running machine.  I planning to try it inside my running linux machine. i thought i won't work creating a image in inside a running machine
make sure the partition isnt mounted though.  i backed up my windows partition from inside linux, i suggest you use a live CD though
So its ok to run partimage inside a running linux machine even though the one i create or the source i want to create a image i the one running.
again -- the partition youre going to work on needs to be unmounted -- but since you dont know what that means im going to tell you the safest thing to do --- from within linux it doesnt work(you can do it and prove me wrong) -- use a live CD
thanks you very much..may i ask again do you know similar to partimage that work inside a running linux by creating an image..i mean creating a image from a running linux machine..hope you know something alike.  creating an image in which the source is the running linux machine with out umounting it. or you dont want to boot to live cd. to run it.
the problem with setting a static ip with network-manager still running is network-manager overrides that in a few seconds and sets it back to dhcp
if you want to do static ip i believe that you will have to turn off network-manager and dhcbd completely
but, if i shutdown network-manager, i lose connectivity. so i shoud try to shutdown dhcbd as well then?

my touchpad doesn't work after upgrading rto 17.04 from 16.04. Ideas?
synclient TouchpadOff=0
sudo? or admin priviledges?.  That might explain.... synclient not installed.....
you don't need sudo for using that command.  its provided by this package. sudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics. install it, restart and try to enable touchpad with the command i gave you
synaptics driver not loaded? is it normal for ubuntu not to install packages needed for hardware?
ok, warning appeared during upgrade to 9.04 saying that 9.04 doesn't have an AMD 'fglrx' graphics driver, what should I do? should I continue the upgrades?
what graphic card do you have?
umm how do i figure this out? I have an inspiron 1521 w/ whatever came with it

can anyone help. i'm looking to install Limewire
Can anyone help me: http://askubuntu.com/questions/350390/set-a-static-ip-to-lubuntu-on-virtualbox ? :(
is that your question?
yes
did you set up port forwarding in your router? you have to
ummm no, it wasn't stated anywhere, can you refer me to what should I do exactly?
google for 'how to set up port forwarding in router'
yeah, but which port should I forward?.  O'.  I'm using bridged adapter, not NAT
http://www.howtogeek.com/122641/how-to-forward-ports-to-a-virtual-machine-and-use-it-as-a-server/
it's relevant to NAT, I'm using a bridged adapter
did you check that you aren't using an IP already used on the network?
yeah
I need to be able to play files that use DRM. no, it doesn't.
'need'?? ;)
and the ubuntu wiki says that it is unable to play them..  well, no. :P
IMHO you 'need' to boycott such filth ;)
some sites don't have an alternative. like mediazone
so don't visit them.  and/or complain to them that you are unable to view their broken media files ;)
but then I would have to go without my beloved Rugby.  well, luckily they DO say that they know the problem exists
video files of sport are DRM'd? wtf?
and they are looking for a way to support alternative OS's
that's good news
I don't know why, either.. ><
sounds like they're trying
yes, but this is their advice: Please check back periodically and make your wishes known with Apple and Microsoft..  they also mention linux, just not in that sentence.
buck passing, sounds like
there must be some type of hack which allows me to watch it ><.  they also say this: (MediaZone currently supports only Windows Media Player, but other media formats will be supported soon).
I doubt MS is forcing them to use drm
here's hoping.....  yeah, why would they use drm? are there any advantages?
suggest they use xvid, which is an open standard and supported by OSS ;).  are you sure it's drm rather than just a proprietary codec?
pretty sure. look: Regrettably at this time, you cannot watch MediaZone's live events or other entertainment using the Macintosh or Linux operating systems due to Windows Media Digital Rights Management (DRM) lack of support for these operating systems.
hi all, what is the current best practice with SSD's in regards to over provisioning and TRIM support?. my SSD has TRIM support, so I should skip over provisioning, right?
just add noatime,discard to your fstab.  kernel > 2.6.32 must be used
thank you, I figured that was all i needed. I also add elevator=noop to /etc/default/grub. I definately don't want cfq on an SSD
I have a question about networking. I did a reinstall of ubuntu server 16.04 (the last one only completed half on a distupgrade and since it was running for over 10 years I decided it was a good idea to reinstall) and my networkmanager does not connect with my wifi. nmtui-connect does not show any networks. iwlist wlan0 scanning does show all wifi networks in the neighborhood. Wifi does connect during. installation and does also connects when I ifdown wlan0; wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf; After that everything works as hoped for until reboot. Does anyone has suggestions how to solve this problem?. :). utp worked from the start
what you did would be temporary.  so it is a desktop version you are using...  What network card are you using. ?
I installed ubuntu-server which secondairy acts as mediaplayer so I installed xubuntu-desktop using apt
Well ubuntu server doeesn't use network-manager. You have to set it all up manually
Good to know. I prefer to use /etc/network/interfaces (since that is what I used before). Although when I start it (ifup wlan0), it keeps hanging on DCHP_REQUEST
use wpa_cli
The machine is a Foxconn NetBox-nT330i with Atheros AR8131M.  Where can I best configure that to run it on boot?
where are drivers located? I'd like to copy them over to create a backup
most are built into the kernel
aren't they modules?
yeah, they can be (and usually are) compiled as modules-- but they are distributed with the kernel in most cases.  what drivers did you want to back up?
basically the ones I currently have on my Ubuntu install of 10.04
there's no need to do that. unless you have proprietary drivers for weird devices, all future kernels will support what it supports today. for the most part
"for the most part", I remember I had to download a driver when I upgraded from 9.10 to 10.04
you mean nvidia/graphic card drivers?
a wifi driver
Judge Jackson has written it all down in the finding of facts, iat the end of the MS vs US trial. It is an very long, but very interseting read
that goes for you too
what?
ah, thanks. Do I want to use the kernel's framebuffer device interface?
that could be the problem, i would say no, but yes might work.
I'll try no, then. selecting keyboard... XKB set shuold be left alone, right?
alright... so i'm stuck connected to my computer through ssh only... anyone know how to actually start a vnc server remotely, preferably tightvnc?
sudo /etc/init.d/tightvnc start ?
will do
Hey. Does anyone know why a liveCD wouldnt work?. it stops halfway through. Mmm I guess ill use a different live cd. is there a guide to setting up a dualboot with xp?. thanks
Make sure you have some unpartitioned space (4+ GB) unless you are okay to use the Ubuntu resizer, then simply boot the install CD and go.

Hey everyone, I upgraded Firefox to 1.5 and now whenever I click on a link in an external program it does not open up, do I need to set it as some kind of super-default browser or something somewhere?
tell  about ff1.5. !tell  about ff1.5.  that ubotu msg should set you up properly for firefox 1.5
yes those are the instructions I used to install ff1.5
anyone here have experience with ipod touch and rhythmbox?
No, but I haven't heard of ANYTHING under Linux that can talk to the Touch.
I am using lucid, and it recognized it right off the bad.. *bat
as what?
an ipod touch
Fascinating. Using what program?
dj_seffault1, I can browse the files using nautilus, but it just shows up as a device in rhythmbox and I can see all of my music...I can even play some of it on my laptop....but it has really screwed up my touch now cause it says no music on it.
So it sees it as an external USB storage device, but not a music player. Sorry to hear your music got messed up. Hope you had it backed up.
I'm not so sure it sees it as just an external usb mass storage...why else would it show up in rhythmbox?.  the music is still on the device, for some reason it isn't recognizing it though.
I cannot orient myself in '.config - Linux Kernel v2.6.24.3 Configuration' Where would I find there the line CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y?
just search for it?
What do you mean by "just search"?
well, in most apps you can search inside a file for stuff.  just open the file in a texteditor that can, if this is a textfile which I assume
Excellent! I am speaking about a program and not a file.
okay, then what program? or is the program called ".config".  or am I tlaking to the wrong person here? (goes checking)
The program's name is '.config - Linux Kernel v2.6.24.3 Configuration'. I have clearly stated that in my question at the outset.
hehe, you don't expect me to know the name of every program ever written, do you? To me that seems like the .config file for a kernel. Anyhows, good luck ;)
Enjoy Ubuntu!
I cant get the rythembox applete to work either
it won't work - it's old rhythmbox went to dbus ages ago and the gdesklet still uses bonobo
oh ok
I had to write some short scripts and add them to a panel to control rhythmbox while it is minimized
are there any other media players that support applets
hi, does anyone know how to configure which virtual terminal is chosen on boot? I'm booting to console but currently vt 7 (I think) is selected (no login prompt) but I have to do the old Ctrl-alt-F1 thing to switch back to vt 1 so I can login
it sounds like its trying to boot to graphical which is on vt7, which is why there is no prompt
hmm ok, any idea how to stop it doing that?
!find libmediainfo0. please help me. I get Audio LAVC. Couldn't find encoder for codec libmp3lame. please help me. I get Audio LAVC, couldn't find encoder for codec libmp3lame.
what are you trying to do?
I am trying to reencode to mp4, which works on my work laptop. but the same command doesn't work on my home computer
I need help. I am trying to rebuild my boot loader. When I am in the grub program, I have to do the root command. however. I don't know how to translate my harddisk information for grub
upgrade_grub. update*. sorry
its fine, so I run that command after I boot into the live CD?
YOU UBUNTU SYSTEM IS NOT YET INSTALLED ?. oops
it is
sorry for the caps
i had to fix a hal.dll error on my windows hard drive. and now it won't let me choose what operating system to boot into. it goes straight to windows
then just boot in it and update_grub from your ubuntu
i can't, even if i force the computer to look at that hard drive
i think id would do it
it gives me an error
hi all..
greetinbs. *greetings* damn dyslexia ...
just was stuck in a code in which snmp_send ... does not return anything, looks like crashes.... how can i debugg it ?. hi  :). m new in c also...:(
!c++. !c
c yeap!!!
pretty sure they have an IRC channel ...

you can check ntfs in linux using ntfsresize and -fi /dev/device right?
for errors?
geeek, filesystem errors, yes. any of you use badblocks to check for bad sectors in linux ... even on ntfs systems?
I think that worked.... got some kinit error and a beep on console after restarting the machine (after I was in X). that's a first time ever that's happened
get your nvidia working?
I think so... I hope there is nothing I need to "enable".  I mean, I am trying compiz. and it seems like it's work. errr working ;)
is compiz actually working ?
yah
So, I'm looking to getting into developing ontop of ubuntu, where do I start?
what language?
thinking c, c++, but i'm fluent in python
for c and c++ 'apt-get install build-essential' would get you the basics installed.  outside of that, google is your friend - there is a lot of stuff on blogs out there for specific languages/environments
thank you sir
glad to help - hope that gets you started at least :-)
when it's installed, where are the help docs stored? /usr/share?
how do i get rid of the screenlets manager in the system tray?
i had same problem apt-get remove is like the only way i found
ok
the widgets arent worth it in my opinion and if you are annoyed by them remove em
i mostly wanted to find out what it was
keep looking at the options in screenlet manager and see if you can hide it in notification bar but i couldnt find it when I was using them
yes, but hiding it isn't the same as shutting it down. and it's still running...
anybody here uses ekiga?
I have in the recent past.  hoping to get into it some more and maybe learn about asterisk
...did you manage to get it to work?
. yes
when i start it..i always get a message saying that i failed to register and that it timed out
you are going to want to find a link to a better repo probably still, this was only about a week ago.  look for v3.0.1 in a repository that is not in your sources and it will fix it
i've got hardy installed on ...and i've got version 3.0.0 installed
close all of the ports if you opened any in your router and use stun
how do i use stun?
hi, how do I scan a directory for files different from a given extension? for example, scan /media/data for NON mp3 files
you may use <unconvertable> find <unconvertable>
I tried to read the 'find' man page, but couldn't find anything useful for the purpose
search for "not".  and "-iname".  if you used zsh, you could do something like **/^*.mp3(.) :)
got it: -type f -not -iname "*.mp3"
quick question, how good would virtualbox work in an MSI Wind netbook?
not well tbh
i knew that...i was hoping to hear an intelligent, dissenting opinion. hehe :D
I have the Eee and XP runs modestly at best.  I have 2GB
you actually ran virtualbox in it?
rarely
yeah but it's in there?
Does anyone know why my atheros card won't work with ndiswrapper? says the driver is installed and the hardware is detected
which atheros card?
5006EG wireless
are you sure?.. there's been some detection issues w/ that device, it gets dtected as ar5006EG, Ar5007EG and AR242x
indy: ah yes ok.. i could try getting anotther windows driver for it and see what happens then
how does lspci identify your wireless device
Indy: Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications, Inc. AR5006EG 802.11 b/g Wireless PCI Express Adapter (rev 01)
what version of ubuntu are you using
7.04 as far as i know, the G one
open a terminal and type this w/o quotes.. "lsb_release -a" (thats a lowercase L)
It's 7.10, gutsy
i can help you get that device working... but we'll have to priv. chat, cuz i'll need to rapidshare you some files
Ok, just let me know how.
test. Hello. I use ubuntu and want full disk encryption like in Truecrypt, where nothing except the boot loader is unencrypted. Is this possible with Ubuntu?
Yes
how?
I wish I could get 1400x1050 working on my D600
you can.  Edit your xorg.conf
Tried that, but still didn't have the option in gnom e
when editing GRUB, custom settings within grub_cmd_linux_default should be added before "quiet splash" or after? Or it doesn't matter?
order isn't important, just make sure you don't use options more than once and you should be fine
Thanks. Thing is my touchpad doesn't work (it never does straight after installation). However, in previous installations, I could fix the issue by addind the option "i8041.kbdreset=1"... but now that doesn't have an effect. I can't wrap my mind around the fact that two fresh installations will produce different behaviors on the same computer. And then, that these options will have different effects on the same system. The only. difference I could think of was that I was adding the options into GRUB in a different order each time
that sounds very odd indeed if the distro's and versions you install offer the same GRUB versions.. if kernel versions differed I could see how that might change things.. did you find that specific i8041 param via a bug report or something?
I found it on askubuntu. And some people with my same laptop have referred to that as a solution to the trackpad issue in different forums. That always worked for me. But I also never had the nouveau.modeset=0 issue before. It's weird indeed. Perhaps I'm not remembering right and last time I installed 14.04 instead of 16.04. In any case, it's strange that i8042.kbdreset=1 doesn't work now. It seems the synaptics driver is not being loaded
