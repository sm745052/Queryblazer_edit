Hi, upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04 on my thinkpad x220. Have a couple of issues related to video and im not sure if it relates to having x-swat ppa on my previous install. basically when I hot undock my laptop from my docking station the graphics glitch out and everything but the mouse cursor flickers. only way to resolve is switch to a vterm and kill Xorg.. was wondering what troubleshooting steps I can take before I restore my 12.04 system image.
common upgrade practice is to remove all custom PPAs *beforehand* so that could be a good start
I had forgotten id enabled it :( since everything worked so well. I tried the x-swat repo in trusty but theres no updated packages. I tried the xorg-edgers ppa and these drivers have the same issues
my point was to run built-in, not look for yet more PPAs to break and confuse things :)
presumably after the update I had built in? that was acting broken
Hey. Does anyone know if flashplugin-nonfree will be updated soon to fix compatibility with Opera?
I hope they don't mess with it more.. it's finally working again on firefox
Yeah, I'm happy that at least ff works. But Opera's been broken ever since the breakage began. :(
it uses the same plugin?
Yes.
guys, i need some serious help. I screwed up my Xserver. when I boot my computer, it won't load X, so it goes to a unix shell, or whatever you call that. I was installing some packages to get a game to work. some Gl and mesa svga and shit
you need to look at /var/logs/X11/XFree86.something.log
basically, i was being careless.  what do I find in there? I looked but wasn't sure what to look for
sorry. /var/log/XFree86.something.log. you want to look for some kind of Error. Fatal's are good ;)
okay. on the startup, i found an error. i think it was saying it failed to load hw_random. something like that
paste in #flood
called it Fatal
nice.
, let me get that.  i'm sending it in #flood.  did you see what i posted?
yep. looking at it
k
hrm im not sure how to help you with that one.
that all?.  check out this, maybe this is helpful
Please is there someone who can help me out with multi disk preseed?. Or point me in the right direction...

partman doesn't seem to support multiple disks
first my BIOS flash went bad, then I had to get another mobo, because the flash i have is soldered onboard.... now Ubuntu doesn't want to install correctly with SLI... now what to do?
what mobo are you using btw?
does anyone else here run nvidia SLI on their machines?
ok, ignore me. and yes, i do.
I am running an Asus M2N-SLI deluxe edition with dual nvidia 8600GT (256MG DDR3)
oh, sorry.
I wasn't ignoring you, lol, I was just typing.. and I'm kinda slow at it lol
i know my bad, i apologise. errr... iirc the M2N range had a few problems with the bios mem?
I have 4GB of DDR2 RAM also.. with the AMD 6400+ proc @ 3.2GHz... I am trying to figure out why SLI won't work and why my dual 500GB hadd's keep giving me errors on bootup.  if that's the case, should I try a bios update then?
please do
I am now kinda gunshy at it since I fried my Gigabyte mobo by trying to flash it lol
hang in here for a sec..  back ;)
I know that the Asus has an EZ Flash 2 flash setup, but still, I am REALLY kinda scared, heh...
pftt.  just go for it imo
I probly will be, as soon as I can get it installed and grab what I need first. I think it's installing ok this time... I hope......
my VPN from home to work is playing up. bear with me.
no problem
Hmm. If I specify some debian/testing sources in synaptic.. Is there any way to make synaptic "prefer" the ubuntu packages?
you don't want to add debian to your sources.list
Hmm. Well, is there another way to get some other packages like psi?
Anyone know how to get past the stuck boot of "ANSI: 05"?. -.-. Guys, how do I fix a hung boot? All it does is sit there at " _ "
try text in kernel option.  or reinstall grub from live cd
Well the thing is  sometimes when even trying to get into Recovery Mode it hangs after loading the CDRom Drive and shows ANSI: 05. ?
so use text mode (no x), you can pretty much fix all from console, press e in grub and add text option. if it fails try live cd
Where do I add the text option ?. remove quiet and splash?. Put text?
in kernel line, instead of quiet splash
k
what do you mean sometimes?
Well in recovery mode it sometimes boots in and sometimes doesn't and gets stuck.. I added the text option and now it's asking for login and password. I know my pass -.-, but have no idea what it wants for the login..
i suspect your username
=-p. I tried it.. There we go.. Now it's just sitting at "primedeath@primedeath-linux:~$
check logs (/var/log) and try... dpkg. what is command to fix X? reconfigure what?
"Gtk-warning". Cannot opend display..  Excuse my complete ignorance.
for what command?.  one is sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg, but before try xinit -- :1 vt7, search for broken instalations and kernel and system logs should show whats wrong
I did the recovery mode to fix broken packages, all were fine..  xinit -- :1 vt7 took me to a very tiny looking shell in the upper left of the screen.. I cannot input commands.
move mouse to it...
I cimoment. moment*. SOrry, back . Should I do the dpkg thing now?
try startx.  in this small terminal.  you under gnome, are you?
xinit : no such file or directory (errno 2) unable to connect to X server. No such process (errno 3) Serve Error. Server*. Aye, GNOME
install gdm, but first from those small, white terminall run for examplae nautilus
Okay, Nautilus worked.. Started with errors though... "gconf_value_free: Assertion ` value != Null ' faled
startx should also work in same way, if not try sudo apt-get install gdm
Okay, I'll have to restart unless you know another way to get another terminal going. It's stuck showing Nautilus errors at the moment.
Alt Ctrl F2 or F3
Nothin'
ups.. is Caps Lock still working?
? Huh? Caps lock works fine but has no use, heh.
can u hover with mouse terminal and press Ctrl-Z
Oh neat
?
I do apt-get install gdm but just says it's already the newest version
if you killed nautilus try startx.  if not kill %1
Magic. It started now..  It started but I hope it'll work upon reboot.
check logs first. for sure u need to reinstall something ro remove, you can use same method or change grub option.
which log file do I look at?
check your drivers if any and run apt-get with self check optons
The only driver I use that's third party is ATI's.
what can be problem also services in your sytem (start up stuff), remove all you do not need... and upgrade.
excuse my ignorance once again. Where are the startup items located?.  It's to the point where I won't find out what exactly went wrong. I think I am going to format the ext4 partition and reinstall. Going to mvoe all my files to my NTFS partition (setup files) and start again. I know I should learn how to fix this at the moment. I just don't have the time.
dont give up ;) or remove X (and gnome) to have more fun
LOL. I am a student and I just need my OS to work so i can continue to study!. So, blech!. Haha... Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't shy away from this if ti was any other day.
what version are you using? 10.04?
10.10. Also, the thing is. I don't know why changing my theme first slowed everything down.... Caused graphical lag and the video that was playing started to skip. Then I went to restart,a nd bam.. Stuck at the desktop background.. No HDD Activity.
Hi, system (Jaunty) is it clearing the history on every reboot. Can anyone tell me how to avoid this?
which history? firefox?
no, terminal history
open nautilus and browse to /home/yourusername press ctrl+h to show hidden files is there a file called .bash_history there?
yes, there is a .bash_history file there
right click that file choose properties>permissions is it set to read write and your user name in owner and gropup. group
I just checked. it was not owned by me. So I changed the ownership of the file. Was this the only cause. If so then I can confirm this on next boot.

yeah still got the problem.  I can receive but not send!
What should I do to fix a computer starting in low graphics mode? 13.10 fglrx. Works fine if I start in the advanced mode and hit resume
How did you intstall the fglrx driver ?
software & updates --> Addition Drivers and it looks like I have fglrx-updates
ajulmira: Additional drivers is pretty smart, but, what retruns from terminal command -> lspci -nnk | grep -iA3 vga <- (maybe no longer supported card ?)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Tahiti PRO [Radeon HD 7950] [1002:679a] Subsystem: PC Partner Limited / Sapphire Technology Device [174b:3000] Kernel driver in use: fglrx_pci. 01:00.1 Audio device [0403]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Tahiti XT HDMI Audio [Radeon HD 7970 Series] [1002:aaa0]. The driver seems to work fine if I start up through the advanced option in grub and just resume.
if I, as user, begin installing audio software, Ardour, Rosegarden, etc... will I run out of room on my initial drive space, as the default in ubuntu? or should I be looking to A) install programs from somewhere else? (admin), or (root, or B) increase my drive space for this user?
that really depends on how you've got your drive set up, and how big it is.
thanks... i've got a 300 GB 2nd drive just installed ubuntu onto, gave it the whole drive
then / and /home are on the same ~300 GB partition, so it doesn't matter if you're installing them for your user into /home/username or as root
what's a software that shows a graphical use of the mount points? i'll load that and let you know, 
Accessories > Disk Usage Analyzer.  but if you let ubuntu take the whole drive, you should only have one mount point at /
so / and /home, ok, nodidng... running Disk Usage Analyser on filesystem, really cool! :). uh, oh... / reports 100%, usr 80.6 % /var 12.7 %
that doesn't mean % full, just % of total
can i check the mount point with that utility also? or another one?
which mount point?
hope i'm asking intellingent questions.... well, you said just / should be mounted, not / and /home i took it to mean?
nono. what I'm saying is that your /home directory is on the same partition as every other directory, so you'd be using the same space whether you installed as your user or as root
well, ok, now i'm scanning 'home' and it shows that my download and desktop and music are only going to be 4.0 kb. ok, i understand you 
sometimes / and /home are on different partitions, or different drives, and then what i said above are not necessarily the case
thank you. so all is ok, but when I install Ardour for instance, as i just did, which directory did that go to, as default
sure thing. the only other thing i'd recommend is that, if you're installing programs that exist in the ubuntu repositories, use the ones in the ubuntu repositories and install using apt-get, aptitude, or synaptic.  depends, how did you install it?.  (installing with the ubuntu software center is fine, too)
ahhh, good info, thanks  i installed from my login  that i created at the installation process time, and i used Ubuntu Software Package. i've used synaptic, ok. in the past I've used synaptic, so Ubuntu Software install is oktoo ?
okay, good, that's how you should install things :) when you install using any of those tools, the files are scattered in a few different places, depending on what they are. user binaries go to /usr/bin, libraries to /usr/lib, some extra stuff to /usr/share, ...
thank you a lot! I'm going to go now, and I'll look over the logs of this conversation too!.  I appreciate it, good bye! :)

What is the simpliest, easiest way to get a static IPv6 address on an Ubuntu 8.04 server from behind a NAT device?
define "get"?.  your NATing device should not matter at all as long as it can route IPv6.  however, you still need your ISP to allocate you an IPv6 address (or a block of addresses :))
I want to be able to ssh into my server using IPv6, so I'll need an address with global scope.
vfw, i found that i cannot ping anything in the 10.9.0.X range even though they are in the same subnet. wierd
maybe the router or router config?.  reboot the router??
its a cisco ASA which works with the other 400 pcs in the building... which plugs into a cisco 4500 switch and then into this computer... the local dns server plugs into the same switch

hello all, how do i force redetection os an usb device from terminal? besides restarting udev, which does not work for me...

swapping a hard drive into a computer with totally different hardware and processor wouldn't work would it? os wise 9ubuntu). would it boot?
that kind of thing works surprisingly well in some cases. Trouble starts mostly when X starts.
soudray: yeah wlell i got his ubuntu on a p4, i wnna put this hardrive into a computer with an amd
p4/amd won't be a problem
basically, i got another computer but don't wanna reinstall and reconfigure everything
it's worth a try.

i hate some deps in ubuntu.... mplayer's are rediculous and incorrect. so no really good way to lock packs from updating?. i want to keep my kernel, and NOT go to 2.6.12
just tell it to hold the package

Can someone tell me why my "3 steps to passwordless ssh remote login" does not work --> http://scsys.co.uk:8001/8658
probably just a typo in there.
does it look logical?
frank: it's essentially correct as-is.
but it's not working for me
Just type in the path when you generate the key. Name it uniquely.
I'll try again
maybe dsa not rsa, also. and edit ~/.ssh/config
I don't have a ~/.ssh/config
they're good to have handy (.ssh/config file). Makes things easier when you try to login from the machine that has the ~/.config file to the one with only ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.. I meant ~/.ssh/config of course. typo.
sorry, you say that makes it easier but, how is a mystery
it allows you to skip the command line parameters and just type 'ssh myremotehostname'.
ic, well for now I want to keep the steps to a minimum, but thx
Hi. I've installed guest additions via 'additional drivers' in a guest machine (virtualbox). but I don't know how to remove them. Deactivating that option is not enough. Any ideas?

ok.  thanks
ok, now that i have made a partition in gparted, how do i get it mounted?

yeah, running Adobe Flash 10.0 r42
would you mind telling me some of the conflicting solutions? I'm curious. I'd be happy to give you my solutions

uhm i have issues building the crappy driver
yea... tell me about it.  it took forever to get working
uhm okay. :D
only some of them work too.  how are you building it
i got 046d:08f6. with driver qc-usb-messenger-1.7. i got 046d:08f5 as well if that one works better. i tried with make install and the included ./quickcam.sh script.  http://rafb.net/p/ek5OWO24.html this is the failure
use modprobe
which module?. quickcam nvm.  [11398.151142] usbcore: registered new interface driver quickcam. it does not say it registered a /dev/videoX
you need qc-usb
not qc-usb-messenger?
either should be fine.  do you have module-assistand. *assistant
yes
are you using it to compile
uhm no. should I?
uh huh.  type sudo m-a
then?
first scroll to update, and hit enter to update.  then prepare
ok, got both
then select and scroll until you find the driver and hit space to select it
ok, got it
then tab and do "ok"

if I wanted to add something to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH that affects all users, what is the best way to do this?
you shouldn't need to do that
I installed something from source in /opt, should it do it on it's own?

oh ok...is there a way to check this just to be sure?
For some reason, I have lost my pub_key
no more getting smashed for you!
lol. I can't figure out how to get it back

heya. anyone having trouble suspending on 14.04.3. everytime i suspend my laptop, put it in my bag, hop on the bike, to get home with a cooking laptop.. it's ridiculous
put the pc off while your not using it?
i've been doing that but then i'd have to star everything up....my browser and all the tabs, im sure you can appreciate the benefits of suspending a laptop?. so shutting is down is not an option.
ubuntu version?
14.04.3. perfectly up to date running on a dell precision m3800. thats why it's strange that it doesnt work. maybe it's because i dont have swap?
check your syslog and dmesg.  and try laptop-mode-tools
great, thanks! i was going to dig into it, but thought i'd ask here - maybe it's a frequent question. thanks for the help  +1
tail -f /var/log/syslog and go suspending might spit out some usefull things also perhaps?
. got it. cat /proc/acpi/wakeup. show you all the wakeup calls. i disabled all of them except PWRB & LID0
solved now?
i hope so, i disabled the lid too and only allowed the power button to wake the laptop. man this laptop get scary hot in my bag. im sure it wont last log if this happens to frequently
did you vacuum clean it once?
no it's brand new.  ^^. heheeh. har har

anyone know how i can test my sound card. i think it just got fried. maybe a terminal command to give me some info on it?
aplay /dev/urandom should give you some noise (might be loud).  there are some switches for aplay to get info about the soundcards.. man aplay for more info
should it be all crackly???
it should just be noise.. regular "turn on the radio between stations" noise
any idea what i could do next? ;).  i have no idea how to go about this.  i'm looking at the man pages now
I'm not on friendly terms with alsa myself.. we have a small agreement.. I don't mess with it and it keeps working most of the time..=)
i was like that too, then it just stopped working. also on my windows dual boot :(
I'm sorry.. can't really help you with that.. perhaps someone else can
thanks for the help!
Hello! Does anybody use Smuxi for IRCing? Do you have working indicator?. I'm tired with it :) It always starts a new instance. but if there is new messages, then it opens old process. And when window is hidden i cant use xdotool or wmctrl to check instance. No one uses Smuxi?
People in #smuxi probably do
great idea! Thanks

had a few weird happenings with the laptop lately. I shut down the laptop, but if I open the lid, it comes back on automatically. Seems to be somehow linked with making some changes in powertop. Anyone else seen this?
I have not run into that problem. Sounds more so like a hardware issue rather than OS.
its a possiblity, just hasnt happened until recently, and I have had the same laptop since August.. Either an update or me messing with powertop. Guess I can try shutting down without powertop tweaks to confirm
What kind of laptop is it?
a Lenovo Ideapad Z570
change the read/write permission for the files you are trying to modify you must be root to change permission on most things in the /etc folder

are you sure its installed
I can find some entries with "find . / -name "*zlib*" but cant be sure which one is install path
aptitude install zlib1g-dev.  usually when compiling you need to install development versions of packages. the development libraries have code that the runtime libraries do not.
that command fixed my problem , thank you dearly

you'll need two physical devices
because of?
because thats how the cloud system works

different stuff. i was just using my browser. sometimes i'm watching movies
I still don't get what "broadcast" in /etc/network/interfaces mean? :)
-> man interfaces
I have read it, it still isn't really clear.
-> the nic has to know what is the broadcast address
So, it's the same as my static IP?
-> nope, do you mind doing a tutorial on networking?
Not at all, have a link or something?
-> not off hand, let me google one for you
Is it even necessary?. .. to write it in I meant.
-> http://www.comptechdoc.org/independent/networking/guide/ perhaps chapter 4
thanks. I can't just leave it empty by any chance?
-> try it, and see how it goes
I don't have a router or anything, it's just static..  what is the network in there then? :D. I only know of my IP, Gateway and DNS.. Oh, and netmask.
-> i can not explain to you all the minute details, you really have to do a network tutorial
I just meant what I should write there. :D. But yeah, I guess you're right.
-> it is easy to tell you what to put, but your are questioning why..then you must do a tutorial to get a deeper understanding
I'm sorry if I'm being ignorant. I just want my connection up and running, it's messing with me.. I'm dual-booting so it's a pain to troubleshoot.
-> explain or elaborate on your network layout.. and please use the nick prefix so your messages will not be missed
it's just a wired network, straight from my card to the wall, and I have a static IP..  I guess that's it? :)
whats behind that wall? your ISP ?
yeah. Nothing in between, no firewall, no DHCP router.

at boot you can hold shift and see the menu of what grub has detected as bootable since last update
i have the menu with multiple linux distros i can choose from. i just want to know which distros grub is the one that i see
the destro you see when grub boots as default? I don't understand that.  grub is not a destro it can boot many different destro
i installed multiple linux distros. each of the installed grub. i dont know which one ive installed least and i want to figure out which ones grub is the active one

Hi, I have an old laptop with a 1.66Ghz cpu. When I run the cat /proc/cpuinfo command it shows this but under "cpu_MHz" it shows 1000. Should it not show 1600? thanks
your CPU will clock up and down as needed, this saves power.  your CPU does not always run at full speed unless needed
sorta like intel boost? Whats so special with intel boost so? Thanks

i putty over to a lamp server w/ zenoss and suddnly the connection is lost (software reset) . after that I can't reach the box until some period of time
hmmm.....are you sure it is a SSH server issue? If you have physical access to the server, maybe you can try running tcpdump on it
it seems the server refuses my connection , even for http after i lose ssh. as soon as i re-establish ssh connection - everythinke else works.  also, other machines on the same network, can access the machine when i can't
how do i give permision to a user to mount ntfs partitions? please help :-s

ok so i have a small problem, nothing dire, but whenever my screen pops up to ask me for my password to change a system setting, say when i go to my Update Manager, the screen dims, but when i type the password in, the window still sits there, the background is still dim, but it accepted my password... so in order to get the window out of the way, and the screen bright again, i have to drag any window around as if i'm erasing th. e dimmed area with my current window... any thoughts?
- I haven't seen a fix for that bug yet, but i could be wrong
so it's a known issue? i just remember dealing with stuff like that in windows 98 or something. it's just a little annoying, considering i like my desktop flawless and styled nicely
Hey guys!. I have Ubuntu 9.04 and a microphone from an icemat headset and i know it works but i cant say anything in it? which driver do i need?
have you unmuted it in the volume control? by default it is muted.
dralid: where is that button?
by default in the upper right corner of the screen is a sound icon, right click and go to open volume control, then go to the recording section.
dralid: there are many drivers? but i still cant call people on skype? "problem with the audio playback"
can anyone tell me why a command I inserted into the beginning of /etc/init.d/rc.local does not run when I boot the system? (please ubuntupeople)
what command did you put there?
a command to start the net. i put in : echo "password" | sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
you should be putting it in /etc/rc.local not /etc/init.d/rc.local
thats strange. i thought etc was configuration and init.d was boot. okz thankyou 
anyone have any ideas what's going on here? I'm really worried :/ http://pastie.org/1140420
Looks like a issue on their end, its not returning the SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received string
i'm logged into the server luckily. but I think I broke it earlier hwen I did a apt-get auto-remove. how can I check what the issue is?
Yo, is it somehow possible to create bootable windows USB installer, from the terminal?
of course. all the gui tools are merely the pretty face of the underlying CLI commands
I've tried the `dd` method, but it does not seem to work for me :/. Okey, so do you know what commands I have to use?
I am using i3 window manager with Ubuntu 14.04. I am trying to find a way to have ubuntu automount usb/sd drives. What is the easiest way to do this??. rvm --default use 2.1.1. sorry xD
usb does already, internal HD use fstab. if you want the either mounted specifically like a place let us know, just a vague question
No, it doesn't mount already. That is the issue
when plugged in or plugged when booted?
I guess most tiling wwindow managers don't automount, if I run nautilus, it will mount but besides that.. it won't automount booted or plugged in on any of my tested tiling window managers
Ah, must be a config somewhere.. or missing driver, never used the manger is all. can you mount from the cli
I need a full fledged solution, nothing is missing. I need to actually come up with an automount solution, that is why I asked lol.. willee: Yeah, mounting works fine. willee: is it possible to have my Windows Manager load up the default actions that Unity would take?. I mean like the exact same file
how do i use a build.xml file to install a program?. whats the command in termainl to run xml files
that sounds like a build file for ant. ant install or such usually. You'll need java installed
ant install is the command?
ant is like make. It follows whatever instructions are in build.xml to compile/install the program.
yeah its a java program, so do i enter ant install build.xml
usually ant install there should be a README.txt or such
it says the "ant" command isnt found.  which is strange because I have java installed and have used iot
preety please...how do you identify wich program is using a specific port using the cli?
netstat is the program you use
with wich options?
I now know why apt is not working, i have to update. But why are the forums down for me .
broken dns
scnuffle: google and everything is alright

My login process has crashed or frozen on my other computer. I can login to terminal. How can I force the restart of the gui?
you can just sudo reboot. i dont know about gnome/unity.  I just use Kubuntu
I would prefer to not reboot if possible..  I also use kubuntu
hello. i need to install windows AFTER installing ubuntu... i don't want to but i need to :-). how do i go about? i suppose i need a partition. pop in a live CD and use gparted?
depends on your needs, you can even install windows on a Virtual machine.  but if you do need to install, you'll need spare partition, if you don't have space use a live partitioning tool to make room, then install windows, then reinstall boot manager (grub)
i do have windows in a VM with Virtualbox, but unfortunately the microphone does not work. i only need Windows to test a Voip app we are developing, so i need it :-)
after i put all of my files in a folder, what is the command to turn it into an .iso?
is this just a data image  or do you plan to use it for video?
data 
you can use brasero for a gui, or dd for the terminal.  which do you prefer?
terminal
dd if=/location of=name.iso.  ^^
oh im not making one right now  this is for future reference. in case i have to tonight
Is something wrong with the us repositories some pkgs can't be downloaded?
in hoary?
yes
Actually, I guess this is worth sharing just to bring more light to the world: http://jrs-s.net/2015/02/03/will-zfs-and-non-ecc-ram-kill-your-data/
assuming the theory is correct, then you "only" need to add big amounts of ram exclusively for your file system, cool. and a ups for the comp, too. zfs is just not for the desktop, no matter what
Research! It's the only solution to ignorance. You don't need a ton of RAM. You don't need a UPS. But you seem to have an agenda, so I'll concede all your points and move on with life. :P
yeah, you don't need to have a lot of ram, you can also settle with a slow fs. for no good reason
Conceded! Next?
I have a hdd connected to my laptop at all times and ubuntu installed on ssd, how do I permanently mount the hdd so I can see it from ubuntu and install dropbox on it etc?
what do you mean by permanently mount?.  you can add it to the fstab and have it mounted at a certain mountpoint if you want
yes that would be it, an article about it?
get it's uuid with blkid.  then type nano /etc/fstab and add it there. UUID=<uuid> <mountpoint> <file system type> errors=remount-ro 0 1. or use whatever options you want.  you need sudo to edit it btw
how does this look? UUID=51DDB6994E6674F0 /mnt/caddy ntfs errors=remount-ro 0 1
it's ok, give it a shot, caddy has to be created first though
wanted to ask that
so sudo mkdir /mnt/caddy
with root permissions right?. ah ok
anyone on kubuntu 15.04?. ?
all the folks in #kubuntu are - but if you ask your next question, it might be easier to help
It still feels super unstable. Spotify doesnt work, windows have "seizures" so to speak when i minimize maximize open or close them.
does anybody here use exaile?. i want to know if it organizes music in the folder...
Do you mean reordering them at their location? ie: In your music folder?
yes.  like if i have a song of van halen in the best of both worlds album, i want it to be placed under /Van Halen/Best of Both Worlds/song.mp3. in the music folder...
anyone have a server list for synaptic package manager to make my life easy :P. like any reccomendations!?. :))

thanks  :). wow  ;) nice!
what this means: An upgrade from 'trusty' to 'vivid' is not supported with this tool
you cant upgrade from 14.04 to 15.04. you need to upgrade to 14.10 before
but i cant. software updater ony alow to update 15.04. is this some kinda bug?
Fresh instal of ubuntu 11.04. Now almost all my problems have been fixed. How safe is it to remove old headers by uname -a then deleting all but the header that shows up?
I wipe out the old headers in synaptic without issues, except for the time I wiped out the current header, that did work out well
uname -a I guess lists the current header. so you don't delete that good one. Also the synaptics residual cofig. I can't remove those
that's a bug
Yeah cause I can mark for removal but not check apply. so apply doesn't work
uhm anyone knows where could i change text colors used on shell? i messed something up at some point heh :|
Depends. Are we talking just in gnome-terminal (the terminal app), or in TTYs as well?.  If the former, it's under edit->profile preferences.
basically text in focused software center window is white, can see it only due to shadows

I'm working on porting an older version of Erlang onto Ubuntu 10.04 (needed to ensure our software works correctly). From my research it looks like I can use dget to download the source package from 8.04 on my 10.04 machine and then build it there. What I'm unclear about is how to get the 8.04 build dependencies on the 10.04 machine. Should I use apt-get build-dep, and use pinning to download the packages from 8.04 (but this means pollut
your software defenitely does not run with the new version?
no
you could file a regression bug
I'm interested in how to build .deb from a different version of linux. or rather distro
apt-get source and dpkg-buildpackages -us -uc afterwards.  but, if there are lib dependencies, which cannot be installed.  cause new ubuntu needs the newer libs, there will be a big problem
Won't apt-get source just pull the code from 10?
how many packages do you need?.  if you do it on 8.0.4 you geth them.  for 10 you are right of course
Fritsch: How would I do it from a 10 machine?
you could add src sources for the old version.  and fetch apt-get source with this special version.  apt-get source erlangPackage=1.0.x.y.  what erlang packages do you have installed?
Okay, I guess if I setup the pinnings correctly then I will not end up with more packages from 8 on 10 than I need
i hope so
is there a way to do it without messing around with apt and the sources file?
before rebuilding, you could also add the lucid binary sources.  and install the mdirectly.  meaning add: deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid main restricted universe multiverse
I believe I need, erlang-base, erlang-dev and erlang-nox
apt-get update && apt-get install erlang-base=1.0.x.y.  replacing 1.0.x.y with the version you need
ideally I want to rebuild it on 10 so it is native for 10, then use the PPA to setup future servers
okay, so just get the 8.04 sources, buildpackages, bump your version number, that it is bigger than the 10 version.  i would rather fix the current erlang version.  do you have an error mesage, what happens, if you run your software on the 10 version?
Sadly it isn't that simple
erlang is rather old, so if 10 version is not working anymore, this is a big problem
The code does not compile with a newer version of Erlang, and while updates exist for to correct this. These updates break other things
so the ubuntu erlang version is broken?
Not at all, we are forced to run an old version of ejabberd, and an old version of ejabberd is not compatible with Erlang R13
http://www.erlang-solutions.com/section/72/packages <- did you have a look here.  oha, okay.  no chance of porting?
No
okay, than there is no other solution, just messing up :-).  let me have a look of the build depends
TBH, I haven't had a change to go through the build deps, I spent a lot of time yesterday on pbuilder - but I was on a 64bit machine, and need to compile for a 32bit one..  However pbuilder didn't seem to setup the tool chain correctly for i386
i see i386, i686, x86, etc... x64 vs amd64... i don't understand the details of the convention on when to use what. So here, this guy's published a "386" package and "amd64" pacakge:. https://github.com/mh-cbon/go-bin-deb/releases. I can only ASSUME, that the amd64 will work for any 64 bit OS, and has nothing to do with actual AMD processor type. And the 386... shouldn't it just be x86?
x86 and i386 are 32bit. x86_64 and amd64 are 64bit
is there a reason you know of why someone woud publish with a specific name like amd64, if it worked on any 64 bit OS?
It's just tradition to call the 64bit amd64, because AMD was the one who invented the 64 bit extensions
: how about the 386 name, doesn't it also work for 586 and 686?
But it doesn't actually matter if the CPU is AMD or Intel.  Yep.
of course i wouldn't really care, but apparently the package manager apparently is using that as a lookup characteristic.  is there a place we can look to see what ubuntu actually looks for when it's deciding if there's a matching package? Is it x64, amd64, all of the above, etc?.  : Ok, interesting.... https://codeshare.io/G8JAxj
so I'm having a hard time booting into my 10.04 installation
what does it do...
it just sits there
OK, now was anything written to the MBR? Since GRUB isn't working?
Try to reinstall Kubuntu as mode 'expert' when you boot.
Was anything written to the MBR? Since GRUB isn't working?
If you run the installation CD with 'expert'mode
Because of SATA, I had to install using "boot: linux pci=noacpi"

I need help getting the internet set up on my ubuntu. I usually use a usb-wifi adapter, but it doesnt have a driver for ubuntu
what wireless card do you have?
It isnt a wireless card. Its a usb adapter to wifi. Netgear WNDA3100 V2
long story short, if you don't have a CAT5 internet connection you're gonna have to download the .tar.gz and build it from the makefile
A what?
the cable that plugs the internet into your computer directly from the router
ok. the .tar.gz for what?
I'm having issues with bluetooth. 'sudo hcitool cc [address] ; sudo hcitool auth [address]' returns 'HCI authentication request failed: Input/output error'
for some devices like my bluetooth speakers I've had to push the reset botton to get them released from the last device they were bond to
so, clearing the memory so to speak...
it clear the bind it had with my android phone so my computer could use it
well, this is when the device in question is in discoverable mode, so it's not looking for a specific device to connect to, just any device to connect to.

In 8.04 after i boot up if I open a web browser and view a flash video or audio then I am unable to hear sound coming from a local audio source (i.e mp3).. but then if I open a local audio file first, i can then no longer hear audio in flash. I have to restart the computer to reset the whole process of this. any ideas?
Sadly, this is a known bug in Pulseaudio. Our best suggestion is switching all the audio preferences and gstreamer-properties over to ALSA.
Everything is already switched to ALSA :(

I did that

How is this possible: I linked a program from /opt/ to /bin and It won't run, http://pastebin.com/z2SQaRga
as yo see, it searches for other dirs/files in $PWD which don't exist in bin/
so it's a program problem, not linking it?
it works, if you call "/opt/openoffice4/program/soffice" directly?
yes, . I just made aooffice to be a script, that does 'cd /opt/openoffice4/program/ ' and then './soffice' . And it works. Even /usr/bin/soffice (that comes from LibreOffice is actually a script. Only thing that wasn't done was installing AOO menu icons, because .deb provided by Apache does not work on Ubuntu. Must report that to them to fix that
yes, because those change $PWD into the /opt/openoffice.... where other needed files are found. your simple symlink doesn't, so it fails
yes, it is application's problem. Application expect same-named other files on same location, e.g. it is specific to name of executable. Suppose AOO and Libreoffice share that problem, and are for that named soffice still
is there a way to stop ubuntu from saving "recent documents"?
well yes sort of

Hello im trying to install ubuntu but i get kernel_tread_helper+0x6 what to do?. And alot of error messages before it seems
how are you installing?
CD..
what version?
11.04
32 or 64 bit?
32
how far into the install did you get?
The brown image with the icon on the bottom.. if you know what i mean?
i have a clean install of ubuntu 11.04 .. but when i try apt-cache search nginx or varnish. i guess my /etc/apt/sources.list is misconfigured
sudo apt-get update first
i've done that already.. sources.list only has: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu natty main
What is the problem exactly? Packages are missing?
no, i want to install nginx. apt-get install nginx is not giving me anything
sudo apt-get install nginx does what?.  What does it do?
Package nginx is not available, but is referred to by another package.. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or. is only available from another source. E: Package 'nginx' has no installation candidate
apt-get install nginx-full
can't find that package either
It's in the universe repo. Enable it in syanptic.

How can I restart the sound in Gnome? (Mine seems to not be working this login.)
has it worked prior?
Yeah, always.
and if you log out and back into GNOME?
I think I might have confused it by having the sound card in use with wvdial in tty1 while I was logging in on tty7..  I was wondering if I could do it without that, so I wouldn't have to break an IM conversation.
How do I check if I have Xgl or AIGLX?
what graphics card are you using?
nVidia Corporation NV11 [GeForce2 MX/MX 400]
are you using the nvidia binary drivers?
I'm not sure. How do I check?
are you on using feisty?
yes.
System -> Admin -> Restricted Driver manager
yes, I see it in the window and it's in use.
well you can use AIGLX. To turn compiz on just go into System->Preferences->Desktop effects
I cannot use desktop effects since the title bars of windows will disappear.
you tried?
I tried enabling desktop effects, but the title bars dissapeared, so I could not move the windows around. Other than that, it worked.
oh well ask in #ubuntu-effects for help witht that
is there an alternative?
How do I make a new user with permission to mount harddrives and setup a program to use it?
A user needing sudo?
wildc4rd, well.. id rather not give sudo permissions to it
so, to get rid of whatever is managing my display went to tty1, executed "export DISPLAY=0.0; metacity -replace" and killed metacity.... i can restart metacity, but no other wm? (awesome, i3, ...) - they can't open display.... any hint?
why are you needing to do this?
want to try some tiling wms?
Hi all. I have been using ubuntu 10.10 for almost 6 moths and now want to shift to KUbuntu....what you guys suggest for KDE?

Okay, I got FTP access, nevermind.. How do I enable uploading?
?
For vsftpd..  For vsftpd.
Anyone here who has gotten ics to work with a windows client to an ubuntu host?
yes
Okay. I am having some problems. After following this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing?action=show&redirect=InternetConnectionSharing it still doesn't work. I cannot ping the host on the client side and vice versa after connecting
I just followed that guide yesterday for two machines in virtualbox.. it worked for me.. I still have to enable ip_forwarding manuall after I reboot... but apart from that it should work
Maybe I haven't enabled ip_forwarding? How do I do that?
sudo -i then echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward then exit no reboot needed.. it should start working right away
Nope, still cannot ping. Maybe there is some problem with the eth1 device? Can I check that it is working correctly somehow?
ehm.. I'm not really sure.. network cards usually work if they are detected by lspci and such.. I don't really know how to "test" any other way
Okay..  Is a system reboot required after that ics guide?
I got a problem..... installed a game demo, and it installed itself in a folder on the desktop. sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/dvd. sudo hdparm -k1 /dev/dvd. I got a problem..... installed a game demo, and it installed itself in a folder on the desktop. The problem is that the demo changed the rights for the Desktop folder.. how do i change it back?
"sudo chmod 755 /home/desktop/folder" ??
thanx tuxicity i'll try that
weird the makefile is in place, however it Make is not working

so i've been using screen for years and moved to byobu cause i like it but the one problem is that the passphrases i have saved in my keyring arnt accessable in byobu. so i have to keep typing them in instead of just once. any advice?. specifically for rsa keys
sudo apt-get install keychain; man keychain
i have a working keyring the problem is it doesn't work into byobu, will this pipe through?
hello, how do i change my fqdn on ubuntu server?
edit /etc/hostname
i did that already.  but hostname -fqdn still shows as the old one
So you're set!
hostname gives me example.net while hostname -fqdn gives me example.com. the right one is example.net
Did you logout and back in? Unless you start a new shell, logout/back in, etc., the shell variable will still be set to the old value.
oh i didnt. thanks i'll try.  same old wrong one.  any idea why? =|
So if you type, "hostname" at the command prompt and press enter, the result differs from what you have in /etc/hostname?
oh im talking about hostname --fqdn.  im talking about hostname --fqdn, which gives me diff result from hostname.  "hostname --fqdn" gives me "example.com" while "hostname" gives me "example.net"... the correct value should be example.net.  under /etc/hosts i have xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx example.net
Do, "sudo hostname example.net" to set it. Then make sure /etc/hostname has example.net for it to be persistant.
i did that already.  could it have anything to do with resolv.conf?
resolv.conf is for name resolution of external hosts.
ohh, then any idea why?
It should contain your nameserver(s)
no in fact it contains example.com in resolv.conf
ok dumb question time............... new to ubuntu..........what is apt-get and how do i use?
It's a command like program to install/uninstall programs. Using the Synaptic frontend is usually recommended.. *line
:S  after reading a forum........i found that best way to fix my problem is threw apt-get. as the other guy with the exact same problem that was the only way he won ;)
Well, to use it, start a terminal and use 'sudo apt-get [install/remove/whatever] [package name] .'
does it list or do i have to know the name?
Hi, i need a small non-gui program to burn a image to a disk. any suggetstion?
is it cd or dvd?
cd
every time i try starting X, I get failed to load module flgrx. module does not exist. it's installed though and i even loaded it up with modprobe. then i get "no screens found".
dpkg -l |grep fglrx
yeah, it didn't list anything
then I don't think you have any drivers for radeons from amd installed at all
i've made sure fglrx is installed. modprobe -l even shows it loaded. or is flgrx just a generic driver? if so, not to bug, but do you know how to get ahold of ati drivers from cli?
if there is no package at all installed which has "fglrx" as part of the name then the drivers are not installed. and you said there'd be none
yeah, but fglrx is installed. i've reinstalled it just to maybe see if it'd fix a broken .conf file somewhere maybe.f
is there any other way to get my wirless without ndiswrapper
get another wireless card
yeah can you recomend one that has no hassle
hi all :). Looking for driver of my Wirless Adapter on my Hp dv6000 !. Can anyone helps me ?
I have a dv6000, got it working using ndiswrapper and the windows driver
>> how can i manage this ? apt-get install ?
is there anyway to make wget try again if it gets a message other than 200 OK? like every so often it gets a 500 error and doing it a 2nd time succeeds for me
could write a script, grep the output, and loop if failed.
i would think wget would just have an option for it though
doubt it.. OK .. a simple manpage lookup. -t, --tries=NUMBER set number of retries to NUMBER (0 unlimits).
the man pages doesnt specify what it means as successful.  hopefully only 200 responses
last time I put a new graphics card in everything just worked fine, then asked if I wanted to use a restricted driver. this time around, I can't get a gui up
what resolution does your monitor support and what do you have it set at?
fourteen by nine, I'm not sure what it's set at though. I was using vga with onboard graphics when I switched. I just noticed that in my xserv log file though, it says no screens were detected when it fails
im using xchat, where can i disable the auto-exit when pressing the [X] on the top right of the window
what are you using?
xchat irc
sorry, I thought you said you were "not" using xchat :)
the first time i used it, it asked me if i wanted to quit xchat, but now it doesnt ask anymore and i would like it to ask again
problem with a broken package, no idea how to fix it. # apt-get install libglib2.0-dev. The following packages have unmet dependencies: libglib2.0-dev: Depends: libglib2.0-0 (= 2.22.2-0ubuntu1) but 2.22.3-0ubuntu1 is to be installed. E: Broken packages. 9.10
the packages are broken, check if there is a bug logged, if not log one
vanilla sources.list.  no buglogged..
then I suggest you log one
o man.... running a production machine here. need to go live today
so ?.  then you should do proper planning
yeah .. i know ' no guarantees'
no, just proper planning and testing
been testing and planning for 3 months
then how do you not know the package is broken ?
it worked fine 3 weeks ago
so you're deploying a machine on the day it's supposed to go live, that doesn't seem like a good plan.  also as you know ubuntu is updated on a regular basis, have you kept up with the package status for your deployment ?
that is where it went wrong, i have not been at the machine for some weeks
ok, so that's not planning
i know, i scored below average on my ITIL test
log a bug for it
will do
consider using LTS releases 10.04 for example for production use
not that it might interest you, but i built a 9.10 machine in april, for use with my collegues in .nl.. it worked perfectly then. the 'plan' was to hold all updates and upgrades. i am working in congo now, and i need that machine today. the small joke is that someone DID in fact do an upgrade
Question one. Is it safe to remove a corrupt Open Office file? The file that is corrupt is "file///home/user/.openoffice.org/openoffice/ofice.xcu"
Make a backup, remove the file, if it fixes the problem then good to go. If not, replace with backup.
Thanks so much ....(that's a loooong moniker)
How do I turn off compiz ?
System -> Preferences -> Appearance
what if I can't access X?
Can you get to the GDM login screen?
Well for now my system works completely.  but I am certain once I update my compiz packages, I will be able to get to GDM but not to gnome.  I've had this behaviour twice before and had to reinstall
Certainly no need to reinstall because of that, you can start a failsafe gnome session from the GDM login screen, or disable compiz from the terminal
I checked appearance, it seems to be turned off tho. So I don't get it.
So what exactly is the problem? You have compiz installed but not enabled and when you update it it tries to start but fails even though it shouldn't have tried to start in the first place?
Yes.  it's the only packages that aren't updated.  when I update, gnome freezes on login.  it flashes the bars a few times and then freezes and my Hd goes way up.  it must be compiz, it's the only packages left I haven't updated
What happens when you login in a failsafe-gnome session?
I shall install them now. wish me luck
If you don't have another computer get irssi so you can get help without X
compiz, compiz-core, compiz-fusion-plugins-extra, compiz-gnome, compiz-plugins, libdecoration0. those are the ones I'm updating to 1:0.6.2.  ok, should I do a full reboot or just ctrl+backspace?
just ctrl+alt+bckspace
I don't get it, I did the update twice from an install cd, once from starting all the way with LTS. Always clean install, X always froze, always same behaviour, now it works. It's what kept me from updating so long
Would anyone happen to know the name of the daemon that let you run it on a box with speakers attached.. then use another computer/client to play music to it?. It was pretty short name.. haven't heard of it in years, so maybe theres something better now..
im not sure but i think ssh can do it via mocp. yeah doc
Hrm, I'll look into it. Thanks. :)

Can I have a bootable usb drive that i can write onto while running that OS as well for normal file storage use?
sure, have multiple partitions on it

I don't know who does the bot scripting, but the !fixres suggestion to 'sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart' doesn't seem to work, it just stops X, though I cannot be sure if that is just my computer
you replaced the ? right?
: yes
and what did you do before that?
: I just followed the instructions on how to change the resolutions
what did you do exactly?
: I was able to restart X because I remembered the command used, and it seemed to work after that, it just didn't auto-restart like I expected
that command works here

hello #ubuntu. I'm having a problem here, I accidently rm'd my /etc/apache2/php.ini ... I already tried -o somethingsomething --force-confmiss which didn't work from http://askubuntu.com/questions/66533/how-can-i-restore-configuration-files ... any hints?
make sure you tried the somethingsomething for the right package
well.. in the above line I mistyped the path. that was /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini I have to assume that it's in php5-libapache2
why are you assuming? Your link gives you the command to find out the package
dpkg -S does NOT list the php.ini file..  so I have to assume it is created during some post-install measure.
grep the .postinstall files in /var/lib/dpkg/info for it then.  probably, don't restrict yourself to just postinstall
thanks for this hint. will go on from here and return with further questions.
Hello. Since I installed the nVidia proprietary driver, my splash image disappeared. How can I fix that?

yes.  ^
barretg: what options did you use on fsck?
i've been having lots of raid failures, having to force reassemble, ran fsck once and it found tons of errors, then had more failures, turned out to be my power supply which I replaced. full raid6 back up and stable. i was just doing a final check "sudo fsck /dev/md0".  comes back immediatly with "/dev/md0: clean, 1295041/244174848 files, 1783753695/1953382912 blocks"

Can anyone help me with the sound problem I have? Sometimes a program will take sole control of the sound, and then I can't get other programs to play sound, even after quitting the program and restarting my sound server...
it means one of 2 things: a) pulseaudio isn't setup right, or b) you have a half-duplex soundcard.
its on a very recent laptop model and the pulse configuration is the default (and not everything goes through pulse either)

Will editing /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf such that the `MAILADDR` is set to <myuser> notify me of degraded arrays when I log in via SSH?. Put another way: how can I be notified of problems with a raid array when I log into my account over SSH?
See "man mdadm.conf"
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be seeing. The MAILADDR line seems to be what I'm looking for, but that doesn't answer my question of whether or not it's sufficient to put my user name
information on MAILADDR and an example.  The example shows user@domain.tld
right, so myuser@localhost? Do I need to install a mail service of some sort?
How do i create a shortcut/link to a file?

you can do 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc' and tell it to install to the other hd. is one way. theres a dozen ways to get grub to install to the other hd.
it would install using dd though wouldnt it?

has anyone successfully installed beryl + aiglx with a Radeon 9800 Pro???
Working with my 9700 Pro.
did u follow a particular guide?
No. It's an R300, it's supposed by the open source drivers..  The 9800, I suspect, probably isn't an R300?
how can i find out?
Google.. Unless you boot of the windows installer CD.. That does. :). Such as?. Windows can't read Linux partitions, so other than the MBR, there isn't anyhting for it.. It does not do that.
xorg.cong has it as a R350 NH

ioria: how do I create a mountable /tmp on an existing system
you want it on a tmpfs?
ioria: yes. ioria: the os already exist it's not a new installation
there should be a systemd mount unit you can enable
I'm a bit lazy hit me with the commands
copy /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount to /etc/systemd and enable it.  /etc/systemd/system, sorry
thanks.  cp: cannot stat /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount: No such file or directory.  or I'm doing something wrong
which ubuntu is this?
Trusty
sorry then, that hasn't got systemd :) hang on, i've got a line somewhere you can put in fstab. give me a minute.
okay, thanks
'tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=1777,size=512M 0 0'.  just adjust size= to whatever you want
son of .... thats should works thanks - I mean it looks good..  you think 512 is enough?
how much ram has your machine got?
12 GB
the way it works is that it allocates what it needs dynamically up to that limit, see what /tmp uses on your system now under normal use
I know I don't need it , based on my ram. ok. tham. thanks
/tmp here uses under a megabyte, but it depends on the software you run.

im using ufw and i have opened this port to whole word.  telnet ip port works from same server, telnet ip port dosnt work from another server

hi. there is possible widescreen (16:9) resolutions in plymouth?
it depends of your video card
Nvidia GTX 360M.  I already have proprietary drive,. but splash and terminals are at very lower resolution. and I can't set wide resolution
it is normal, the propietary drivers have this problem with plymouth.  but yu can fix it
what I found to try is scripts from 2010...  no very confident
which is the best* Kubuntu, Xubuntu or Ubuntu
it's a matter of personal taste
well what are some easily seen differences
the interface.  you can see the differences between them on their respective sites
I know kde, but what is that just default glossy blue slick look? xfce is kinda slim, and Ubuntu is just orange gnome
so.. anyone know any tray application for changing the sound??? like in winblows

Hey guys, can I get some help getting ssh working? I downloaded, installed, and have the sshd_config, and forwarded port 22 to the proper machine, but while outside can see other services running on my machine, it can't see ssh. I can ssh 127.0.0.1 though so I assume it's running
are you sure you forwarded to the correct internal LAN IP?
I would assume so. It's the same one my MC server runs on. My comp is set as static. THough I just sudo apt-get installed ssh-server, opened and closed the config, and restarted the service. I figure default is all I need for what I'm using it for
is this guide: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia not for breezy, cause it says the terminal is in a different spot than i have it. and if so, will following these directions not install my graphics card?
yeah it's for breezy, fix it
fix it?
greets everyone. does anyone know what the "print to file" option available throughout ubuntu uses as a backend?. i want to use it in a bash script
I think, it depends on the application itself. Some applications supprot printing to multiple formats, while others only support postscript and pdf..  also, you can try redirecting the whole thing to a file like, "command > file_name", it might just work out.
i have a program that drives a multifunction printer's fax machine (so that you can print from your computer and have it go out over the mfp's fax), but it only accepts postscript files. so what i'm doing is writing a script that will convert anything that can be printed to .ps
so you want to mass convert to postscript.
yes. i'm working with pdf files right now, which you'd think (since they're basically postscript with some extra info) they'd be easy to convert, but using pdf2ps or pdftops they come out horrible. ideally what i'd like to do is set up a dummy printer -- just like the print to file thing -- that would just save whatever is sent to it to a .ps file. that's one part. but the other part is to be able to convert a lot of different file types to .ps so that they can go out over the fax
this is more than what a bash script could easily handle..You might want to look into perl or maybe ask on #bash..
i'm not having any trouble doing anything except converting the files. i'm using zenity to do all the file selection and GUI stuff
anyone else using rhythmbox as their music player?
sure
do you have smooth transitions between tracks?
define smooth :). like cross fading?
yeah well not necessarily smooth as in faded, but do you get this "silent -> 0.5s bit of strange noise -> new track starts" sort of thingie? :P
I have no strange noise. just track end -> silence switching to new song -> new song
it goes to silent first, and then it plays just a bit from the end of last track, as it would flush buffer or something. could be my ancient cpu tho :P
which rhythmbox do y ou use... the standard one?. rhythmbox-gstreamer. ?
0.8.8 that came with ubuntu hoary..so i suppose its standard
W: Failed to fetch http://packages.medibuntu.org/pool/non-free/f/ffmpeg-extra/libavformat-extra-52_0.5.1-1ubuntu1+medibuntu1_i386.deb. Well that's annoying, because I need to transcode to AAC
doesn't the restrictedformats give you the codecs for AAC https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
sacarlon, does it give me the encoder?. I have a 1.2gb video and want to knock it down for youtube.
you have the encoder you just need the codec.  mplayer also has an encoder
It does? all this time I was using VLC >.<. Of course it does. memcoder -.-.  Where is the 'encoder' options? I'm assuming I can't do it through a UI?
I don't know I haven't played with that in 3 years
I'll just try get vlc and ffmpeg workin' then =/
hi folks. I'm in serious need of some help. my laptop just started lagging like crazy, and I can't find the reason. there isn't a process that's lagging it down. firefox and gaim both crawl right after boot up
where (hardware wise) do you suppose the bottleneck is? RAM/SWAP? CPU? HDD?
I have 2GB of ram... maybe hard drive. I just replaced my hard drive
run 'top' in a terminal
but it was working better than this after I replaced it. this was rather sudden.  okay, I'm running top
what's your system load average? are there processes at the top, eating up all your resources?
~.90. but as soon as I do something, it jumps to 2
how do I stop apache?
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
I still see the default page at localhost
ps aux | grep apache.  kill the PID of the apache proccesses
it worked this time. Can you tell me which directory it reads files from?
the default configdir is: /etc/apache2
I put a html file in /usr/share/apache2/default-site/ but I get a 404 error
each vhost file will define the it's own rootdir for serving files.  by default, its always somewhere in /var/www
ahh, there it is. There is the same html in that dir, that confused me.  thanks
print screen isn't working, what could be the prob? :(

I have now twice in one night had my USB mouse just stop working. It is still lighting up, but all input from it is ignored and I bet it'll stop lighting up if I unplug it and plug it back in. It is a Razer Mamba and I'm on Ubuntu (14.04) with kubuntu-destop installed and KDE desktop active. I have no idea how to troubleshoot this, any ideas?. I'd rather not have to restart multiple times a night to get my USB devices back.. Running "modprobe -c | grep mouse" shows a line that says "blacklist usbmouse" Could that be what is causing my mouse to randomly stop working?. Not sure what modprobe is yet, but I found this relevant: http://askubuntu.com/questions/453689/mouse-not-working-after-installing-14-04-lts-64bit
hi. please add "-C 4" to see context of the grep results..  modprobe -c | grep -C 4 mouse
I did not know I could do that. That's awesome, thanks! Context in this case is a bunch of other blacklists commands. There is an "alias usb:v*p*d*dc*dsc*dp*ic03isc01ip02in* usbmouse" line later in the file.
modprobe shows you information about kernel modules. kernel is the non-gui thing that chats to yuor hardware.
Oh, well that makes sense. Thanks!
I see. you can put some more context to a pastebin if you like (I don't know what these aliases are a part /of/ and I suspect more context could be useful.)
Is there a way to pipe output to a clipboard? Otherwise I'll need to restart again as it's the only way I know to get my mouse back.
you could use the pastebinit tool if you like. it's a package; you run your command and add a "|pastebinit" to the end.
That's awesome. I'll get a pastbin in a moment then..  It's things like that which make me glad I switched to Linux, but man I can tell I'm still green. :P http://paste.ubuntu.com/7754641
I would probably just `modprobe -c | pastebinit`; the last portion is still greek to me.
Thanks for being willing to try to help me. Here is the full result of modprobe -c: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7754651/
I dont get the no operating system found message it says reboot and select propopper boot device
right, because your OS disk does not have a boot sector on it (grub). or valid boot loader I should say. normally because the graphics drivers are shut down. it can't remember the location
huh. I am at the step with the partition menu and it says: ubi-partman failed with exit code 141. further information can be found in /var/log/syslog.. y that my install might fail
repeat the process I told you earlier. that worked last time
I'm restarting the install. the partitions should be gone
why don't you just explain the issue, so that people know if they can help
I got the same message. its perplexing. reboot and select proper boot device
same thing - it's not installing grub to the device you are booting from
can I install grub another way?
the installer is fine, just during the install make sure you select the correct device
it's the whole harddrive
yes, but there are 2 disks in your system, the hard disk and the usb disk
what else is there to select?
Is there a streaming MMS recorder in the Repos (not for KDE please)?

Hi!. I have created a separate partition on my 3 TB external drive for GRUB. but, I want to know how to pre-install GRUB to the pre-made partition. can someone help me pre-install grub?
What do you meant by "pre-install"?
I have made a dedicated partition on my external drive for GRUB. I'm in Ubuntu Studio 13.10. I have a 3 TB external drive
I assume you're doing this because you plan to have multiple GNU/Linux distros installed and want grub to be in a separate partition so that any of them can be deleted without breaking grub. If that's not your end goal, please state your end goal.
well, I am doing this separately from my windows hard drive.. I used GParted to do it. and I have downloaded & extracted GRUB 2 to the dedicated partition
i just downloaded unrealircd and it is a tar.gz file... how do i install those kind of files??? i am new to linux

Who bright and incredibly stupid idea was to update ubuntu-docs?
do you have a support question?
-> because its been several minutes and the update today (ubuntu-docs) is still going and consuming 100% of my cpu. -> and if it doesnt stop soon, ill terminate it prematurely.
hi, i don't mean to troll or anything, but why ubuntu 7.04 is so buggy here? gaim wont start, i get "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" gnome-settings-daemon wont start (i get another error) and themes in gnome doesn't work. i wish everything would just work here
do you have a clean install CD?
yes.  clean system
I just don't understand why when I connect to FreeNode, my internet connects gets down
you are connected to freenode now, so it has not gone down
but I mean the whole connection.  the internet goes down.  very bizarre
what is the best way to keep the functionality of 10.04 on 12.04
functionality in what sense
simple menus, easy to change themes, gnome-panel
install gnome-panel and use that.  or use Xubuntu 12.04
I tried installing gnome-panel but that broke the theming
question regarding upgrade from 10.04 ........ the update manager says there's a dkms update, but when it tries to download it, i get a popup box that says Please insert the disk labeled:. Ubuntu 11.04 _Natty Narwhal_ - Release i386 (20110427.1). in drive /cdrom/. anybody know why that is?
you can "fix" that by removing the CD from your apt sources
how do i do that  ?
hello. anyone here tried to run nullmailer? I just installed it instead of postfix but when I try to telnet localhost 25 the connection is getting refused :O
did postfix run fine before ?
no I really couldn't get it working :S .. have managed to set it up before 1-2 times but I thought that because I only need a relay-smtp I could use some easier solution
do you have a firewall running ?
you mean a firewall as an router where I can open ports etc?..when I think of firewall I always think of something like windows firewall which I can stop but I haven't seen anything like that on ubuntu :O
well I mean both actually. there are also firewalls on ubuntu, could you check the output of 'service ufw status'
ufw start/running
ok so you do have a firewall running
oh hehe :O so I should stop ufw?
either you stop it, or you allow connection on port 25, via "sudo ufw allow 25"
ah yeah thats better ..but do I really need a connection on port 25 on my machine if I only want to use relay-smtp?. @  *
yes your machine will still be seen as a mail server from any client connecting to it, and you will need to allow smtp connections to it
aha oki then I get it  but still after allowing port 25 and trying to telnet localhost 25 I get the same error message while running nullmailer
is the nullmailer service running ?
yeah I guess :P
to be sure, "service nullmailer status"
didn't work they want me to use /etc/init.d/nullmailer instead of service and then there's no status attribute :O
then try "sudo /etc/init.d/nullmailer restart" and then try to connect via telnet again
still same error :P
ok, then back to the firewall... could you pastebin the output of "sudo ufw status" ?
http://pastebin.com/e8uiM3Y4.  don't you mean "sudo service ufw status" ? .. sudo ufw status returns Status:inactive but sudo service ufw status returns ufw start/running
no I meant "sudo ufw status", but then it means that the firewall isn't enabled... so the problem does not come from there unless you have some other firewall running
I have a new installation of ubuntu and haven't installed some other firewall :).  while I was running postfix before I managed to telnet just fine but then the authentication failed :S.  so I guess it's not the firewall
after looking at the documentation, it appears I didn't understand what nullmailer was....  it only handles outgoing messages, so you won't be able to connect to it via smtp.  have a look at the manpages for nullmailer, nullmailer-inject, nullmailer-queue and nullmailer-send
how do you mean only outgoing ? should I still be able to send a message using another SMTP with nullmailer?
yes, but it won't allow you to connect to your machine remotely to do it.  nullmailer is only a set of tools used to send mail from your machine using a remote smtp sever. *server*
aha but still e.g. PHPs mailfunction should work?. aha great  that's what I need
any one can help my pc crashed when I try to upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04.2 when the power is gone pls help how can I recover ?

wpa is a new one for me. not if you don't transfera lot. it would take forever to capture enough packets to crack it
only takes a few hundred MB of transfer iirc.  so maybe a few days on a lightly used network, vs a few min on a heavily used one
exactly
so wep is still useless
for my home network, wep would work... if i didn't open it up to everyone anyway

i need help trying to mount a raid1 etx4 drive using mdadm. i gave it a test_fs flag so i can work with it but i have no idea what to make of the 4 partitions on it. i can only mount sdb3, the rest say "/dev/sdb# has no superblock". the thing is, when i mount just that one, i get input/output errors when trying to copy files of it.
try check the disk
any particular check tool you have in mind?
chkdsk
i have done that. it tests ok, smart reports ok.
on all 4 partitions?
yep, the drive is fine. should i be mounting just the one partition? this is a system that doesn't have the raid setup...
what do you get when you try to mount the first partition
/dev/sdb1 has no superblock
have you any sensitive data on your drive?
.9tb of them
do you know which filesystem is used?
it's ext4 and i had to flag it test_fs otherwise it wouldn't let me work with it.
Where is termcap?. Presumably termcap must either exist, or Ubuntu's parted is not the same as the parted on sourceforge.
not the same youre right
Any suggestions for using a more recent version of parted than that distributed on the live CD?
Anyone experienced with HP laptop wifi issues? The hardware switch bug. The F12 key only toggles soft lock, not hard according to rfkill. even usb wifi adapters fail work properly under the stock GUIs. command line or with wcid usb wifi works fine. seems to be a software issue within the *ubuntu software?. system info. an old HP G6 (dont have the exact model memorized) rt5390pcie, *ubuntu 16.04 x64. doc, do you have your gpu accellerated? check good ol glxgears maybe?. you can change your desktop by just installing a different one (ie: xubuntu-desktop). this HP wifi bug is what is driving me nuts. seems to be no real fix from what i can find. older HP laptops with a nonexistant hardware switch. whats worse? you cant just change the wifi card. the BIOS screams that it isnt compatible :/. some weird bios lockout for the built in wifi unless you are running windows, i guess
cub26 try something like systemctl start dhcpcd@enp6s0.service. replace enp6s0 with whatever your network card is.
service not found?. or rather, not found
find out what your network interface is.. it should be under /dev/
the name? ie wlo1?
possibly?. I haven't had to run anything like that since my archlinux days
I have tried everything i could find online. for acers, rfkill unblock all works. not for this. the only key switch is F12. it only toggles soft on it.. it seems as if the BIOS keeps it locked unless you run windows
that is super unlikely.
it's a dual boot setup and it works under win 10 x64. at some point during the win 10 boot proecess the LED changes color to show it's "on". under linux it doesn't and the raw output according to rfkill is that it only toggles soft
well it probably would if you are using an oem supplied copy of windows, which would have all of the proprietary drivers for your hardware pre-installed.
i reinstalled the OEM Win7 and upgraded to win 10 (bought it used and put in my SSD)
can you pastebin the output of 'sudo lshw -short'
I have a similar HP but much higher end (for 2011). sadly something hardware for display went bad, it has no backlight even with a new screen. it acts the same way for windows. sure. hold on
the second problem you are having is definitely a hardware issue. take apart the bezel of the monitor (if you can) and check that all the wires and ribbon cables are still securely connected. there is usually a chipboard directly beneath the screen that controls the backlight.
the WLX one is the one i'm connected throught right now (USB) https://pastebin.com/W2aTXuQs. wlo1 is the built in WIFI.  yeah i just haven't gotten to it. i have changed the fan a few times on that DV6 one. basically one day it didnt have backlight anymore. i can see it showig on the screen if i have it out in bright sunlight so it has data going to the screen, just no backlight. i bought a replacement screen, put it in, no change. sent the screen back (good ol amazon)
it's not a screen problem.
i know that now ;)
its a problem with the chip that should be seated directly below the screen.
i assumed it was at first
well, try that and you should be golden.
i will one day i guess
how can I delete same lines of a file ? (I mean delete the second line.. so that there are no same lines in the text file)
still here?
yes :)
to eliminate duplicate lines in a file called foo, do 'j="init" ; cat foo | while read i ; do test $i == $j ; j=$i ; done'.  sorry, trying again.  to eliminate duplicate lines in a file called foo, do 'j="init" ; cat foo | while read i ; do test $i == $j || echo $i ; j=$i ; done'.  if you don't mind your lines being sorted, you can just do 'cat foo | sort | uniq'.  argh, I take it all back now
hmm i c :) one question though.. what does j="init" do exactly??
initiates the variable j with a value that is unlikely to be equal to the first line in your file
what if line1 is equal to line 100 ?
hi .. trying to install ubuntu 10.04.4 along side windows xp installed on NTFS partition. I used ntfsresize to shrink the ntfs file system to half size, then used fdisk to delete all 4 primary partitions and then created a ntfs part and a linux part .. when I reboot the live CD, fdisk shows the new fstable I made, but clicking up on 'places' shows my original full size ntfs drive/part --. I did all this cause gparted would change the size of the ntfs partition .. any idease? much thanks
I have a link to a youtube video that I used to do a dual boot you want it?
ehh. well the thing is ... gparted didn't want to resize the ntfs partition so I could add a linux partition
I am reinstalling ubuntu to see if the raid would sense and it did. I made the raid after first install. it found it so now reinstalling
you went and put the /home on there didn't you :(
nope. I havent touched that yet. still installing just to SSD as per normal. but it sense the raid. Once I get installed to SSD with RAID detecting then I will ask for next steps :). I just wanna move my home and cache to the RAID. then set the SSD to read only. That should prolong the SSD life exponentially correct?
still 100% disagree with your plan
Almost indefinnitely
no, your idea is silly. you need to do OS updates regularly, you can't set it read only
Touche...
plus you have a samsung 840, that puppy is good for 10+ years. *minimum*
OK sweet. then I will just use the RAID to store critical data and my databases
when i open GMail, i get alerts in firefox saying "0" doesnt happen on any other site

Hello people, I really need a new laptop, and I want it to run ubuntu well, is there a list I can get of laptops known to work well with Ubuntu? Thanks
check the forums. and what various linux-laptop-computer web sites sell
Okay. Thanks. I was hoping for a list to make life simpler, but I guess that will work.
is there a cmd i can use to increase my network card speed to a more consistant number
you mean to make it faster?
yes it fluctuates
lynx ebay.com is imo the only command to make it faster.  with other words, you cant make your card faster then it is
from 54 to 300. no the speed changes
ah you mean to use wifi in n-mode
yeah. silly me
say, lately I've been having artifacts, large areas of my screen not refreshing and displaying what ever was previouly rendered as if frozen despite changing the content in the area. Might this be a video card problem?

yes, and also on in the 'do not change this bit' bit. you change it on that line for the next update, the others so it takes effet now
removed that line. this one too? "root=UUID=cd7eb660-1de1-460e-916d-7f9a2bc98b3a ro quiet splash"

The permissions on /var/run/mpd reset everytime I reboot, anybody know how to prevent that?
add chown mpd:mpd /var/run/mpd to /etc/rc.local.  but rather file a bug
but do you know what's resetting the permissions each boot?
nope.  this is what i would looking for first.  how do you hange the permissions after you booted?
what?
if you boot and see the right wrong - what are you doing then?
if the see the... right wrong?
you issue chown -R mpd:mpd /var/run/mpd?.  sorry for my bad english: the rights of the folder

Hello again, does it make sense to assume that a 64bit processor will run a 64bit OS better than it would run an i686 OS?
yes
ok thought so.
no sorry i read wrong, 64 bit can be faster though
thats where my issue is. It just seems like my current install is slower than installs ran in the past. All i can think of is 64-vs-i686 problems.

!watchdog. are you using NDIS Wrapper?. is your wireless card USB?. have you tried to modprobe ndiswrapper?. do you see the network when you do sudo iwlist scanning?. have you told NDIS the ID of the network you want to connect to?. the essid i mean
i believe so. I have specified it in interfaces file, and kwifimanager as well. i have entered the WEP key as well
try this: sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid "NetworkNameHere"
i did that. followed by iwconfig wlan0 commit as well
is your network using encryption?
is there some ubuntuese equivalent to snapshot.debian.net ?
you mean a web browsable repository? or more of the version control aspect?
i need a version of a package more recent than dapper, but older than currently in edgy
nope, you'll need to build your own
right. so where do i find older source packages?
older source packages? From the project.  depending on the package, you could get the source to build it from debian
anything other than an orig.tar.gz/digg/gz/dsc trio will be an upstream tarball, not a source package. i don't want to replace my libc and half of gnome with edgy versions to compile a package, when a slightly older version with more sane dependancies would do the job. an old *debian* snapshot, that might work...

no worries good to learn
I can ssh from another computer on the local network though. Is this a known restriction with vmware and/or virtual machines in general?

and the vmware has what? NAT? bridged? host only?
- bridged
I'm sorry for doing such a silly question here, but no one is answering me at #conky. So, I started using Conky today, but I'm getting a weird question mark inside of a box in the end of each line. Anybody here has any idea?
you probably have to configure conky's conkyrc file.  have you taken a look at the conkyrc file to see what it is?
Well, thanks, I already had that in mind. I was just asking if someone here knew what is happening. I made the .conkyrc myself. the only problem that is happening are those square characters

if you have openfire working via the web, it's not an OS problem; it's likely a database problem
ok thats what i thought but i can never seam to get it to worjk
when you go into mysql, you see the database you have created?
i use the internal database that comes with it
ok. so when you reinstall openfire everytime, are you given the opportunity to set an admin password at all?
yes i am and i set different ones each time but still get the same error

hey guys, is there any way to send a message or anything to a windows computer i'm on the same network with?
you can use net send
how?
basically i want to start with only Cacti/Nagios/FreeRadius/Syslog on the server....maybe in the future i might add more.... i just want to secure it from any hackers who could possibly use my server for sending out spam or anything else...
lock down the mail relay, lock down the user accounts, lock down the web interface.  there is no guide
can i post a link on here? i found a guide... just not sure if i should follow this or is there another better way...
Does anybody in here use ndiswrapper?. If ya don't use it don't bug the bot. that's annoying to no end.
just ask thew question you want to ask, please.
the question is about driver installation and why my wireless device is showing up but not broadcasting
what device? how is it attached? what chipset? what device drivers are you using, and from where? how did you install them? can you see SSIDs? etc etc etc.
Belkin f9l1101v1, broadcom, windows drivers via ndiswrapper, Not broadcasting so No ssid
Broadcom what? they make a lot of chipsets.
dunno what broadcom chipset lemme check
BCM4323.  that does not require ndiswrapper.
I beg to differ
BCM43xx drivers for Linux will work with that.
the free drivers don't work
have you booted the machine with the dongle attached so that the kernel knows the device is there when it's choosing what modules to load?
On several occasions
and what does "lsmod | grep bcm" say when you do?
On full hardware boot, virtual machine boot,. prob nothing as i've blacklisted the included drivers. nada
grep b43
waiting. this wireless device has given me a headache with ubuntu since 8.10
Is there any way i can install glibc-2.4 on dapper? i get glibc-2.3.5-0ubuntu1 only to install thru apt-get
Why would you need to revert that?
i need to run truecrypt
And it requires and older version of glibc?
i hav installed it from apt-get, it installed f9 , now when i run it it gives me error
np
truecrypt: /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.4' not found (required by truecrypt)
that is a dangerous lib to change, i dont reccomend it. Have you looked into luks?
okaym i dunno about luks
I'm using it on my whole drive, and it will be sufficient security for what you need, check out using that instead.. !luks | 
ok.. thanx , i will give luks a shot
hi. can any one tell me how to make any site trusted. which means activex is allowed

Hi *. I have a very strange problem with gnome. It doesn't recognize images IF they are named .jpg or .JPG . After I rename them, they work fine. I only have a problem with a user. Where does gnome store this kind of conf?
Probably ~/.gnome or something.
I tried to rename .gnome2, but it didn't work
I hate to give you advice without you accidently wiping something important out. :\.  Does it say access denied or something?.  You may have to do it from another account.
no, but what happens is that it doesn't create thumbnails until I rename the file (e.g. filename.jpg -> filename.jpeg).  from another user, everything is fine
Sometimes I just like removing ~/.* just to clean things out, but sometimes I get overzealous. I wouldn't recommend it though.
it is worse than that. I cannot choose any file.jpg as a desktop background.  I guess that is the only thing for me left to do

...

ah.  you would actually need the server connected to a domain or public IP.  better go back to scp
but its showing nothing.

what package manager were you using?
I was using sudo apt-get on Kubuntu. (I'd try their irc, but hardly anyone is around. )
pgrep -l apt-get
Rylu: 3848 apt-get
do you still have that open somewhere, by any chance?
Raylu, How? I've restarted my computer twice since then.
then apt-get wouldn't be running.  or, at least, the apt-get that you ran two restarts ago wouldn't
Yes, but now I can't install anything. D=

Hey guys, i just bought a asus pci-ac68 dual-band wireless adapter. Everything's is working but for an unknown reason, the stability is really bad. I ignored ipv6 but doesnt change anything. Anyone have a idea r how to improve/debug this ? thx
you mean PCE-AC68, right? which ubuntu version are you running?
yes ! my bad. i read that wl (original driver) are the only one possible and i didnt found any hack on this driver to improve it ( or any issues )

help!! I installed GNOME3 on ubuntu and now nothing appears on the desktop and i can't select anything
common test.. try making a new user, see if they work. also clarify to the channel your version of ubuntu and what you installed exactly.
dr_willis thanks, but i just needed to turn something on in gnome-tweak
why do you need a /boot/ parttion?.  cant say i really have needed to use that tool in ages.
dr_willis :P. my more important problem is that after installing GNOME, when i switch back to unity, the close button is on the right
thats a theme setting for the most part these days. (its tweakable by various tools). the themes just have a script i recall that sets it to the other side,. if you want it moved.. move it back. ;). !controls
dr_willis hmm, i will look, thanks
When I log into my vnc server (which only works on localhost, cant even connect from my other pc on the network) all I get is a term window. How do I make it look like my normal GDM stuff?
one option I might suggest is xdcmp, unless you have a need to control the display
I thought VNC was supposed to let me control this computer (all my windows and apps) from another computer..
it is, but it works by letting you control the same screen as your other computer is using
Thats what I want, but when I log in (at localhost) it starts up with just a term window and a new X session
what package do I need to open rar?
unrar
so just apt-get install unrar?
yes
thanks
hey, i'm back again with the same question - gdm (i think it is gdm's fault) freezes my PC, Ubuntu boots, but when it is mtime to load gdm, it freezes, what to do?. didn't helped
freezes so you can't switch vt's, even?
yes, keyboard works, but linux doesn't act to nothing. i can turn on/off num lock and all those lights :)
can you type CTRL+ALT+F1 to get a login prompt? If you ping the box from somewhere else (if that's a possibility) does it respond?
i cant. ctrl alt f1 or f2 or anything else won't work, also ctrl + c and all those..
hmm. the first thing I would do is boot from the Ubuntu Live disc and take gdm out of the default startup level. then you can boot the system and troubleshoot from the command prompt - if you want to do that.
i don't have the liveCD. so i need to download it
yeah. :(
can it be that my installation CD is bad?
ok, Im trying to get RAR installed and it says i need to put the files in my \usr\sbin\ directory but i dont have write rights..... how do give myself these rights?
you need to use sudo. also, you might consider, if you're installing manually, instead putting them in /usr/local/sbin so they don't get confused with apt-installed packages. also, this is linux--our slashes go forward
lol sorry  :D. and thanks
np! i hope it helps
doh, it says i dont have write rights to /usr/local/sbin/ either
does anyone know how to mount an already existing linux raid array??
the same way you mounted it before. with mdadm
well the last time i did it, i edited the mdraid file, but that's not there anymore
try /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf iirc
if i edit that, and then mount the /dev/md0, would that work??
Does anyone here have experience with preseeding installs? specifically installing custom .deb files that are on the CD along with the installation?
can you give me an example
I am making a custom install CD for a professor of mine and he has a custom made piece of software that he needs installed on the CD, I have it in a deb file and need it to be preinstalled along with the rest of the installation
How can i use my rams to help the performances of my system?
the linux kernel will manage your ram to give you the best performance
right now is only using 11% of it. Can't i do anything to use more of it, and make it efficient ?
why do you think it's only using %11 ?
Ikonia: because that's what conky, and system monitor is telling me,
that means it only needs %11 as "active" at thie moment, you'll find more will be use for things such as disk cache, and when it needs it will swap it to active
so' in another words i can't use any ram space to make my experience smoother?
I installed 14.04 a while back using a daily image. Will the updates bring it to the latest version even upon official release or will I have to reinstall?. sorry wrong chan
yes, when released you will get the final
thanks
Hi! How can I upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 without fast Internet connection? Is it possible if I have 7.04 Live CD only?
you can only upgrade with a CD if it is the alternate CD. !upgrade >  (see the private message from ubotu)
Thank you! What is the 'Alternate CD'? Where can I find it?
if i wanted to encrypt the / fs post-install. is there a way to do that with a lower than 5% chance of eating all my homeworks. ?
There aren't tools to easily do that in-place
presumably it's relatively trivial if you can backup everything outside the [already-encrypted] home partition. aye. truecrypt had some magic for it on windows istr, but god knows. and seems potentially fragile. i'll probably just backup my data and do a reinstall
if the system is using LVM and has reserved some free extents, it should be possible to recreate
what are the important things to save other than homedir, dotfiles and configs from /etc for configured packages. in fact, is it possible to use apt-* to list all configuration files associated with installed non-default packages?. that seems doable and might allow for a relatively interaction-free reconfigure of a fresh install
there'll be configs under /var/lib for some packages too
aye, but apt keeps track of what's config. at least, there's remove/purge so it is savvy to the difference between functionality files and config files
it depends what kind of partitioning the system is currently using, and how its split up. It's sometimes possible to find free space to bootstrap a post-install encryption
ideally, i'd like every change i make to the OS to be stored as in a git repo, with branching, transactional rollback, pull requests, etc.. but this is more than a weekend project and i have difficulties focusing on a problem for more than a few days at a time
hey guys, how can i fix gnome-terminal so it's not set to xterm. i would like to get xterm-256color so i get color in utils like tmux. do i just have to do export TERM=xterm-256color in my bashrc?. i see theres a check in the bashrc that looks for xterm-color?. and then sets a color_prompt
if tmux works similar to screen in this respect, you can set the terminal type in its configuration file
but why does gnome-terminal set itself to xterm :/. and not xterm-256color?. or even gnome-256color
so... noone's ever had the situation where wicd works and networkmanager doesn't?
I have, why?
I'm just trying to work out why 'cos wicd loses the connection but doesn't notice, which nm never seemed to do, so I'd rather use nm
I thought you said wicd works, and nm doesnt?
yeah, on this particular hardware, which is the problem
or more to the point, are you running intrepid, with an atheros wifi card?
nm works fine on all my other hardware, just not this one.  intrepid, rtl8185
can download on transmission be above the bandwidth given by isp?

hello, i installed compiz/xgl using a tutorial and it was working fine. after installing a lot of programs/codecs using automatix it seems to have stopped working since rebooting. can anyone help me?. /usr/bin/thefuture: line 2: gnome-window-decorator: command not found. is the error message i get
automatix tends to break things
i see
you're better of starting from scratch than trying to repair what automatix broke
if i were to go through the tutorial again would it still work? thats if i can find it
could someone explain to me how to install python-mode in emacs? i have the file, just dont know where to put it, or what to do as far as configuring emacs

Can I use that to have a remote display (I dont want NVC). (VNC)
Is there a way to return a number of files in shell?. For instance, instead o listing all files in a directory, how about giving the number of files in a directory?
just files, or directories too?
Files only. I'm recursively searching throughout a directory.. Actually I'm grepp'ing and want the number of files containing the search string
Hi, I'm using 10.04, and for some reason, when I click the firefox icon, firefox will not load. Is this a problem I should ask here, or in another channel?
Alt + f2 > "pkill firefox" (without the quotes), then try it :)
ok, what was that supposed to do? I typed that in, and nothing
hi all. I have a problem. tried all i could and no solution, however i have a feeling it is trivial... i enter my password on login GUI (14.04) and .. i am waiting until computer freezes. everything else seems to be ok.. #ubuntu
might want to try using the boot option "nomodeset".  Start a reboot and hold down the Shift key. Press the e key on getting the GRUB bootloader. Using arrow keys navigate to and delete quiet and splash and type the word nomodeset in their place. Press Ctrl and X at the same time to continue booting.  see if that gets you into your desktop
THX  - i will try it now
you can also access "recovery" while in the grub boot menu too.
i have done all as told. i come to the loging GUI, no errors. I enter my pwd and than .. it is not stuck (mouse moves) but it stops there. ?
hallo; i've accidentally rm -r'ed /boot/grub and i can't get grub back.... i'm running on a live cd now.
chroot and reinstall grub?
i've been trying grub-setup, but it gives me segmentation fault
Not sure where to ask this. Just bought a micro usb cable for use as a data cable for my phone. Turns out that it is a charging cable only. Damn sales rep lied to me when asked about it. Anyway, I saw something on a google search one time about getting charging cables to work as a data cable. Anyone have any experience with that, or know where I should ask?
other than google (or maybe even the ubuntu forums) no. I think the only difference would be that the data cable has more copper connections than the charging one, so I would assume you just add a few. But then Im sucking my thumb.
Thanks. Saw something about just a driver, so not even a hardware solution. Definitely confused, also.
how do i delete an unallocated partition to make room for another?
Get an answer yet? http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/partitioning might help
no i haven't, thanks i will check that out
: Did you want to resize the Windows part or expand the Linux part?
my problem is that my linux partion is just big enough for the system files and i have to room to download updates and etc. Is there anyway to just tell ubuntu where to download to instead?
Ubuntu will download to or in Ubuntu, I guess you can save the downloads on a Flash,CD-R or whatever, I am also pretty certain that you can expand the install, but let me look for that.
ok thanks
You can expand the volume, ext2/ext3 can be expanded with Gparted or some like utility, I find it easier to back up data , do a fresh install with parameters set as you prefer.
i was thinking about that, i just installed Ubuntu a day or two ago so i have no data to loose. If i just start the install process again with the CD will it delete my current install or will i end up with 2 instances of Ubuntu on my system?
It will write over or delete the current install and settings
great thanks i think i will do that
hello guys, I think I messed up my php installation. Any help? this is the error output I am given : https://pastebin.com/Y0w10T1s
Have you tried doing: sudo apt-get -f install && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade ==> to see if the "-f" will FIX the "installation" along with doing the necessary update/upgrade...which sometimes will resolve the "config" issues?
yes with no sucess
And is it safe to assume that you've gone through the process of doing "sudo dpkg-reconfigure" for PHP...?
no..let me try it.  i get "php7.0 is broken or not fully installed"
You can use the "sudo apt-get reinstall php7.0" -> see what does produces...
"Internal Error, No file name for php7.0:amd64" :S
"sudo apt-get -f reinstall php7.0" (or whatever the package name is)
same error..the package name is correct

Hey guys. I just installed Ubuntu. and I wanted my resolution to be 1280x1024. but it's only giving me 1280x800. any ideas?

I have that option too. ok, brb
I'm running 12.04 on a macbook. Gnome-shell crashed, making the UI unusable, so I did a hard reboot and now it looks like my machine is unbootable. Selecting the recovery kernel from the grub menu ends with the message "edd informatino not available". Please, can someone help me recover my machine?
booting from usb ?
no, just the hdd
wow! I guess I am the first one to have that problem :P hehe [Since I didn't see any report in the Ubuntuforum]
is ubuntu on hda3 or hda4?
hda3
then grub should say (hd0,2) and that's what you had
hda4 is the Swap, if I remember correctly...
can you mount the partition from a live cd even?
haven't try to mount from the Live cd.
try it. see if you get an error and if you do post it
how do I mount from the Live cd?. mount /dev/hda3/rescute ?. rescue
Okay, I have the information on the game file. It's in my home directory. I typed file GERally, and here's what it says: "GERally: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.2.5, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped"
then do this: chmod 755 GERally, and then ./GERally
It says, "./GERally: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" Does this mean I'm missing libstdc++, and if I install it, it should work?

how do i build the drivers for it...is there any modprobe for it??
whats better for a hosted server? freebsd or debian?
depends what you want it to do.  i have had hosting on both
a webpage or two.. plus some java
in that case it wouldnt matter. i'd go with the Debian server myself (because i understand it better)
thats why I initially went with debian.. but someone else suggested freebsd.. And I'm wondering how I should weigh the two
if you want your rfcs implemented before the ink is dry use freebsd. if you want 10 year release cyle use Debian, but this is -offtopic
what do you mean by that?
i am trying to install the linux version of utorrent and it comes as a file utorrent-server-3.0-24733.tar.gz i know this is a compressed archive but I have never installed an application like this. would this need to be compiled ?
if untarring it produes the source then yes you need to compile it
only thing that comes out is docs, utserver, and webgui.zip
wait i'm downloading now, i'll get a definite soon
thanks.  it almost seems like to be it isn't for desktop users but for webservers only
tried it now, yeah its run as a daemon/service and its all configured via a html page, not practical for a desktop user i suppose :(.  not like a daemon/service more like a background application
ah so it would be for a headless server environment
any reason why a maverick based "do-release-upgrade" would say no new release found?
you have it set to lts only
where do I cahnge that
i can't get frostwire to work on Jaunty 32bit, i get this error: http://pastebin.com/m462f2f13. im guessing i have the wrong java version, or something
more like a classpath issue
do you know how to go about fixing it?
is this started by a script ?
only by typing 'frostwire' into a terminal
the app is not able to find the jars needed to run - you could see if frostwire is a script - if so, take a look at it and see if it defines the location for the jars
what do you mean, like, look at the /usr/bin/frostwire folder?. er, file
anyone know a good backup program for ubuntu ? im running a web server and want to back up everything

My server, which is run though a dynamic DNS, sometimes just sits at the command prompt, like when im trying to ssh in. It just does nothing, and eventually breaks the connection, this only happens sometimes, but Im worried about people viewing my website (once I get it online). Any idea how I could fix this?
then you should host it properly.  rather than on a home connetion with dynamic dns
this is temporary, until I get some coin :P.  its also a method of me experimenting
Hi. I did a system update yesterday night and when I turned the computer on today, my home directory vanished. I think ecryptfs screwed something up. I was wondering if I could get help recovering my home folder from .Private
did you write down the loooong password that ubuntu gave you after you first set up your encrypted homedir?
yeah
eh, k, I didn't expect that. let me check.
I tried following some instructions to remount it elsewhere, but the mount came up empty
did you try the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory#Recovering Your Data Manually ?
the ones I followed were http://www.kaijanmaki.net/2009/10/26/recovering-files-from-ecryptfs-encrypted-home/. which look very similar. after I mounted it, the mounted home was still empty. but the .Private def has stuff in it
.  looks pretty similar. darn ... can anyone else take alook here? I thought my loopaes experience might help ... but this looks quite different
what happened was I originally had encryption installed. Then I disabled it somehow (I believe by editing some settings file, but I forget what). I then copied my files over to a clean home folder (with no .Private) , and all was good for a few weeks. Then last night, ubuntu did an update and I think overwrote a settings file and this morning, when I turned the machien on, no home folder but a .private folder
I'd try using a livecd to check the home partition directly, without ubuntu trying to mount the encrypted stuff. perhaps something got mixed up there. just a shot in the dark though ..
like use the same instructions, but boot with a livecd first?. is it possible to see if the key I wrote down is correct?
any ideas on how to start a full X session over ssh on another tty? (startx -- :1, for example, but over ssh)
you can see the remote terminal from where you are sitting, and dont want to reach for its keyboard or what?
my daughter is using the desktop. i want to use it for bittorrent and some other stuff while she's using it. i'm on my laptop with wireless and a smaller disk. and dont want to use BT on the laptop
you can ssh -X remotemachine and run an app - it will appear locally.
gee thanks.....
hi all! is ~4.16 MB/s an resonable speed when copying ~450 GB from one portable hdd to another with both useing usb2.0 and 7200rpm?
seems a *little* slow, but nothing too bad... i think my best (observed) results are around 6 MB/s, but copying only 300 GB (on identical 500 GB drives).  also, that was almost all large contiguous files (typically at least 150 MB)
what's the best app to use when doing these kind of large "backups"?
not sure, because so far i've generally just copied the entire volume with dd, or a partitioning program (i even tried just a straight 'cp', but that was painfully slow)
currently copying with roadkil's unstoppable copier (used in the past many times in winxp) through wine now, could that be a "problem"?
after i add a user to a group, is there a way to refresh that somehow?
you'd have to restart if you are that user. I think you can get away with restarting gdm.
how can i restart gdm?
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart.
thanks
you'll be logged out.
yeap
hi guys, i've just upgraded to ubuntu, and x doesn't come up. startx says: "(EE) module ABI major version (0) doesn't match the server's version (1) / Failed to load module "nv" (module requirement mismatch, 0)". what have i done wrong? i followed the upgrade instructions

installing ... i just use the nv driver though, and that's installed
meta packages are good during upgrade period, to make sure nothing is left back
yeah i guess.  heh, and it worked, thanks a bunch!
hi, i have a cable between the modem and between one box. i think that is named patch cable. can i make a netwrok between two boxes with this cable?
if one of your computers has a gigabit adapter then you can use a patch cable to connect them if not then you will need a hub or a switch
how can i detect that?. i think i have one.  how can i detect that and if i have that, how can i make network between the two box?
Small issue... suddenly, my second monitor is refusing to scale to the correct resolution :(. Displays shows it as unknown. I can only get it to go to 1360x768, when the monitor is a 1600x900
suddenly ? was working before ?
correct. Since perhaps a few days ago when I used it last. Only thing I've changed is I let the updater run like I do most every day.
replug firmly the cables ?
It's a DVI/VGA adapter. it's been working for 2 years, and suddenly today booting up, it refuses to allow me to set to the proper resolution in the Display settings.
uname -r ?
3.13.0-49-generic
how can i make sure my secondary network card runs at startup?
the same way you make sure that your primary network card runs at startup
tried that, doing nothing dosent work ;)
I didn't say to do nothing.  you didn't "do nothing" about your other network card. The fact that the install program did it for you doesn't make any difference
the same way you make sure that your primary network card runs at startup <= nothing
Okay! Let me try this again. I am a Microsoft-dependant Ubuntu-Noob trying to get a Linksys WUSB54GC USB Wireless Network Dongle to connect to a Linksys WRT160N Router set to Wireless B/G and WPA Personal Encryption. ( Either TKIS or EAP is accepted) The Dongle works perfectly on Windows XP and Vista, and it works on Karmic when connecting to unsecured networks. Just not to MY network. I have read the article at https://help.ubuntu.
Are you on 9.10 ?.  You there?
Greezmunkey, Yes, I am. It's an updated version fro 9.0x that I installed months ago. It was updated right out of install. Oddly enough, The USB adapter worked when I used NDISWrapper. Just not AFTER I updated.. . Odd that that didn't occur to me before now.
how do i stop this one process from going, i keep killingit but it keeps coming back.
usually that's because there is an auto-restart in one of the init files
yes buti removed it.
It's possible to update via normal updater, isn't it? But, is it better to do a fresh install?
apt-get dist-upgrade works fine
Excellent, thanks. =)
ow?. hi.... !ubuntu-desktop. do u kow how to remove ubuntu-desktop package?. well when i tried to installed it..it takes 2 giga off my hardisk. but when i tried to apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop only xxxmb freed

not yet. i will try it
Is there an easy way to append one wav file to another, with sox perhaps?
you might simply "cat" them together (cat file2.wav >>file1.wav), though it might need some clearing up with sox or something.  and it might not work at all
I did that, wav files have headers so it gets confused

yes, it vanished from there
is it enabled in System> administration > network?
it does not show up in there anymore

Hello guys. Am I the only one to have big problems with chrome on ubuntu 13.10 ?. (problems that are not present in chromium)
what kind of problems ?
sometimes it doesn't run in gui (but create all the process it usually create), but worst, it slows the computer I use to works (that have a SSD !), and when I say "slows", that mean I need to reboot. Using chromium fixes everything, but why chrome for ubuntu exists if it's not compatible ? I have this problems on both of my computers.
That is strange .
that's why i'm here ^^
lol. But chromium works...... What version of Chrome are you running, i assume the newest?
yep, the latest

I dropped images in the folder.
and the bug is reproducible?
I don't know, but when I paste stuff also crashes.
you might have to downgrade, but did the problem start immediately after upgrading to Ibex?
yes.  I'll change to dolphin then ]:).
then i'd have a look to see if a bug has been filed, although i haven't heard of anything like that biting a lot of people. you might be stuck going back to the earlier version..  dolphin?
it's the official KDE file-browser, there is an option in gconf-editor to set which file-browser to start in Gnome.

I see some people at both channels, Debian's and Ubuntu's. I would be interested in knowing which one they would recommend for a Linux newbie. Because, I assume they have used both for a considerable length of time and know both the distros well.
it is, usually, the one you feel better with. Keep in mind that UBuntu relies on Debian (and many Debian devs are Ubuntu devs, and vice-versa)
ok.. I am buying a new laptop this week, which comes without any OS pre installed. I intend to install some good linux OS on it.
Hello :), I am on 9.04 and I am using gparted I am trying to format the whole drive ext4 but It does not work. The drive never gets fully erase and has a lost and found icon on it. It only lets me format fat32. 986GB driv
formatting as ext4 makes it create a lost-and-found directory.  lost+found
how do I format it - it says Lost+found and I do not have permission to use it
if the only thing on the drive is a "Lost+found" directory then everything is correct.  it has been formatted
Johnflux when I try and use the drive it never lets me copy anything at all..  I can not even create a new folder. I have tried a total of 3 ways of formating it. ext3, ext4, and fat32 only fat32 formats.
I'm trying to browse one of my drives, but I get an error saying "Too many open files". What did I do? I was copying alot of files around right before this happened.
just wait a little until the disk is snced again. or, if you want to enforce it you can use the sysrq key or simple reboot.
I don't want to reboot, so I'll wait then. Thanks
try pressing ALT + SYS-RQ + S
alt+sysrq gives me a screenshot
not alt+print
Sys Rq and Print is the same button, no?

hi! can anyone tell me if I forgot to shrink the xfs partition table before shrinking the lvm volume...Is there a recovery possible? /dev/mapper/vg0-lv_root: can't read superblock
there is no such thing as an "xfs partition table". there are msdos and gpt
ok recover superblock then, the data is less than the size of the new lvm volume so the data is there just unreadable
describe which layers of block devices you have there, what you meant to achieve, and which commands you ran..  maybe start with 'lsblk -o +label | nc termbin.com 9999'. welcome
I shrunk the LVM which contains two logical volumes a swap, and a lv,root the lvroot new dimensions is 94 GB while the empty space removed was 9/10 of a TB. http://termbin.com/hurs. simply I forgot to shrink the file system before executing the lvm shrink
can you should those, too (run each with sudo and paste to a pastebin): pvs, vgs, lvs. !pastebin.  whe you say you "shrunk the lvm", do you mean you reduced the size of LV vg0/lv_root or that or PV /dev/sdb2 ?
reduced the size of lv_root. so the result is it no longer mounts because of bad superblock
okay so unless you modified the xfs file system on vg0/lv_root since then you may be able to recover much of it if you're resize it to the exact (to the byte) size it used to have.. * you'll (not "you're")
http://paste.ubuntu.com/25106646/ http://paste.ubuntu.com/25106647/ http://paste.ubuntu.com/25106648/. I am not sure I can size it to the exact byte, It did take the whole disk besides the 4gb original partition but I am not sure I can get it down to the byte
should we assume that the entire useable space available in vg0 used to be allocated before you reduced lv_root? if so, we could just resize it back to the maximum available size and hope it'll be ok.
the other problem is that I did this in order to create a new install on same disk, which I installed afterward (had no other way to do it no other disks, so all the data is on the first 94GB I am sure but the superblock that it refers to is definitely gone
lv_root cannot possibly have been larger than the PV (/dev/sdb2) which is just one of multiple partition son this disk. so the previous lv_root cannot have ever allocated the entire disk space of sdb
I didnt realize that the data or information would spread way beyond that area.  read above
a question!. im trying to install soldier of fortune and i run the .sh file and when i need to choose an installation directory it says i have no permission?

they dont support linux. they r dumb

no. just ubuntu
tell them you need to do a 'manual setup'
they dont even know what linux is. i m telling u. isnt there a command like the pppoeconfig just for cable modems?

no thoughts on rpmforge-like repos for LTS releases?
rpmforge is for redhat - not ubuntu, so it's not a valid question

python 2.7.2
what version of ubuntu

This is weird.. My windows 7 installation. or rather, any another partition on my hard drive isn't being detected. and instead is showing unallocated space. What could be causing this?. I'm trying to install Windows 7 and Ubuntu ( actually, Xubuntu) side by side
does 'sudo fdisk -l' show the windows partition?
is that a question?
yes, as indicated by the "?" at the end of it
it's showing two ntfs partitions on sda1 and sda2. so it does indeed detect it. but gparted shows 100% free unallocated space. so does the Xubuntu installer

everything except the foot and about can be edited at applications:///
thanks! i wish i could just type that into the run dialog :-x

that's exactly right... I think you're stuck with those those
lol. so i can't edit the other menu either?. because there's the "Main Menu" and the "Menu Bar" on the "Add to Panel" thing. was hoping i could edit one of them

So I'm giving up on the temp sensor thing for now. HWE kernel is installed and working with nvidia prop drivers. I can live without the cpu temp for now. but I do want to figure out why grub menu has this black overlay... because as it stands, I can do nothing but wait for grub to boot the default option
' cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp ' The output is mille-degrees celcius .
I'm finding plenty of threads online about black screen AFTER grub. But not during grub. Basically, I get a screen with ubuntu-purple edges, but it's black in the center covering menu options.  that gets me "no such file or directory". But it's fine. I'll just check BIOS for cpu temp, I guess. Can you help me with the grub thing?
I'm putting Ubuntu onto my piece and I'm getting error 15. wat do
grub error 15 ? re-install grub from a live cd
>live CD. Don't have that or a CD ROM. I dl'd it all
usb ?
idk why that'd be necessary, it clais it can do it from C: just the same. *claims. But I did that. Here's what google turned up: http://stringofthoughts.wordpress.com/2009/05/25/grub-error-15-debianubuntu/
what claims can do what from c: ?
Install Ubuntu. Let me find the name of it. I think it's Unetbtin, 
so again, can that box boot from usb ?
It can, but I think it's unnecessary. I don't have an extra flashdrive to spare for this. UNetbootin is its full name
if you need to repair grub, you have to chroot from another sys, the tut you gave is from 2009, grub1, now grub2 is in use.  unetbootin is a tool to boot from usb, yes.  so if you can't boot a cd, you can make a bootable flashdrive, and with c: I assume you talk from a windows box, wherefor unetbootin is also available
Well, I've uninstalled and reinstalled it before,  and that didn't help. ya that's what I'm trying to do
lil' confusing, you in first hand wanted just an usb install ?
No, from C:
sound debugging advice please?. I've gone through ubuntu sound troubleshooting wiki pages and my sound card is configured, yet I still have no sound. Could someone please offer some advice?
keyseir: type of sound card, setup?
"02:0a.1 Input device controller: Creative Labs SB Live! MIDI/Game Port (rev 05)"
keyseir: are you using the digital output on the card?
It worked fine before I reinstalled edgy, but now I'm not getting any sound..  Digital output?
keyseir: single cable going from sound card to an amp of sorts, then to a bunch of speakers
No. I've only got it hooked up to a set of speakers... and I've checked the speakers
keyseir: i ask because I had that same exact problem. just had to enable digital output heh

how can i make my mic work?. argh
check that you have it all set up correctly?
i enabled it on kmix. what other should i set up?
are there any switches that might be off? Is it plugged in the right spot?.  is the mic still muted?
yeah i think so *checking is it plugged on the comp" no it's not muted. but it just not works!
does it definitely work?
yes, it works on winboze, but not on linux
I would think it would be something quite simple then.  if its functioning in windows it should function in linux
hm... maybe it doesn't work only in firefox...
Morning! On artful, I cannot login using gnome/wayland, only gnome/Xorg. What gives? How do I even report this?
don't you get the option to login to the wayland session, does it fail or what happens?
Its just that wayland crashes and bring me back to GDM, the login screen.. COmmand line is fine. Xorg i fine..  wayland crashes.
i don't know where wayland errors are logged, tbh, have you tried looking at logs?
dusasse: I am quite lost. Nothing obvious in the logs, nothing in /var/crashes
i don't know what else to suggest, sorry. what kind of gpu and which driver is this on?
I am not such, it is a 2012 Mac Mini with a 4K screen, which I guess is a but unusual..  *sure.  FOUND some interestiung stuff in syslog: "org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.desktop[1789]: Cannot open display:"
they use amd gpus afaik, so probably the radeon driver. you can check with 'lspci -k', check 'kernel driver in use' under VGA controller
the display has no name.  i915
ok, so intel, not amd
It worked for a few days when artful was new, and then it stopped. Wierd.
could be a driver regression, hard to say
After a good few failure messages, it goes "gnome-session-binary[1734]: CRITICAL: We failed, but the fail whale is dead. Sorry....".  Can this be of interest? "udev-acl.ck[1728]: g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0' failed" ?
some posts i found online seem to indicate this could be a problem in gdm or gnome-settings-daemon....  you could file a bug against gnome-settings-daemon, since that's what throws the "cannot open display" error
The first "cannot open display" is from gnome-screensav, actually.
so, it could be gdm that fails to start wayland. i'm just guessing, though.
should I throw the log onto termbin for you to see?.  look here: http://termbin.com/kynm.  What about THIS during boot? : "[ 17.542201] wl: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel" ???
that must be some other module, do you have something that uses dkms installed? what about those .bashrc errors near the top of the log, are there any problems with parsing that?
I expect them to do gracefuly ignored, as they wrote such a nice set of warnings about them....  should I get rid of the .profile and try again?
guys, what sound system does Ubuntu 10.10 use? I have programs that are actively pushing out working sound, yet I see no pulseaudio daemon running....
it is PulseAudio.
so if there's no daemon running, how are these apps still making sounds?
try running it in the console manually..  like I do know
yeah, that works. I can then control volume, etc. I'm just surprised that the apps were still able to play sounds without the daemon running. what is pulseaudio's equivalent of /dev/dsp, if there is one?
we still have alsa!.  none.
so they fall back to alsa if pulse isn't running?
sure.
I used to be able to capture sounds to file through /dev/dsp. can't do that anymore?
what do i need to install so my network manager auto find wifi availables?
It should already by default
i installed minimal ubuntu 
Do you have nm-applet and NetworkManager running?
how do i knw if i have both running?. i have nm-connection in zombie mode
Check the output of ps ax. You can use grep to narrow it down, for example: ps ax|grep NetworkManager
nm-applet sleeping
Does iwconfig show an interface for your wifi card?
22758 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep --color=auto NetworkManager.  this is my wifi eth1 IEEE 802.11bg ESSID:"punk". it found it as eth1 instead of wlan0
You can do this: sudo iwlist eth1 scan|grep -i essid.  That means NetworkManager is not running. You could try starting it but it may interfere or not work
maybe i need to install more packages? 
Hi. ssh uses my /etc/host file as god intended, but none of my browsers do. Why? (I've flushed the cache, turned off proxies, etc.)
it's /etc/hosts
Sorry. Yes. A typo on my part here. (ssh uses /etc/hosts but my browser don't.)
Can I use gnomebaker for burning ripped dvd's?. I don't see any videomode option in it. or do i need to use the data mode option
i find k3b to work best of the -burners
is there a video-dvd burning option in it ?
Does anyone know how to get the latest version of Ubuntu to recognize a Dell Inspiron 1525 wireless card, if the previous version does?
-> what chip does yours have?
I'm not sure, and using lspci -v | less doesn help
-> try sudo lshw -C network
Under product it says "BCM4312 802.11b/g"
hey guys, i just apt-get install libdvdcss2 like the ubuntu guide told me to do to get DVD playback.. it installed fine.. but i can find where libdvdcss2 is?. or is that not even an app at all?
It will be automatically used by any programs that need it, such as Xine, .. It's just a library.
so, use totem movie player?
so i am trying to fsck a memory drive. As soon as I plug it in my laptop memory card reader it open window manager showing the contents of the mem card. now if find the mount point using sudo fdisk -l and try to run the fsck command appropriately then it gives me warning that it might create errors. now if i unmount the mem card then what /dev/<somethin> or device i run my fsck command on ?. basically need a way to find the path, etc of a unmounted device
An easy way is to do, "df -h" while it's still mounted and take note of the device node...
: fixed it by using the umount command
k
so clicking the eject button in the filemanager is not the same as using the umount command. thanks 
I've this amazing problem where df -h shows 99% disk usage but df -i shows more than 80% inode free. What could be the possible problem?
You have very large files taking up your disk space.
why would then du -sh show just show actual disk space usage?. I did du -sh /
Is it not the same as df's result?
nope. That's what I can't understand. I don't know maybe possible disk failure?
You may have a file that has been deleted, but still exists on your system. Run "sudo lsof | grep -i delete".  And pastebin the output for us.
sure . Thanks. thanks . I got it.. thanks. the nasty log file I believed I deleted it
to make a file read only do i change the permissions for owner, group and others to list files?
read only even for yourself?
yes
chmod a-r file
ty :)
oh no wait
:O
so is it safe to add debian apt sources to ubuntu?. like I would like eric3 (a python IDE ) but its not in warty

Heya, I tried to install Xgl as said in the wiki. As I did the "ln -sf /usr/bin/Xgl /etc/X11/X" and rebooted, X wouldn't start back up. What do I do?
log in on a console (Ctrl-Alt-F1), run 'sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/Xorg /etc/X11/X ; sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart'
I don't have to do the restart, X and gdm can't start. Using kdm btw. But, okay, thanks :)
who said anything about restart?.  have you relinked Xorg?
Doesn't /etc/init.d/gdm restart' reboot?
no, it doesn't. Have you fixed it?
Relinked? Please come again.. Thanks so much for the help!. No, not yet. I have to get all the help I can get and go 7 floors up to my computer and try to fix it
switch to a text console to login, bypassing X, which doesn't work. To do this, hit Ctrl-Alt-F1
Ok
log in with your username and password. Then type 'sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/Xorg /etc/X11/X'. Then type 'sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart'
ok, thanks a bunch!. :)

NTFS formatted external usb drive (usb only), worked yesterday and doesn't today. Mounts correctly and df shows that there is X used/available correctly but 'ls -la /mnt' showx 0 files. I remounted now and I see '.Trash-1000' with some deleted items. WHAT is going on here?
look into 'disks' for smart info, but not all usb controllers pass-through smart info :-(
Disk is OK, 2 bad sectors (23 <unconvertable> C / 73 <unconvertable> F) - Is this it?
jups
The 2 bad sectors can make the files not show up? Will fscking it do the trick?
depends where, if they are in the mbr, you have a problem
ntfsfix was clean - NTFS partition /dev/sda1 was processed successfully- Still the disk only shows the trash dir... Advice?
maybe the files are just deleted , do they appear in your trashcan?
Nah, some files do appear in the trash but I did delete those from the drive. All other files seem to be disappeared
when i right click i see the menu, but i'd like to see it at the top and bottom on my screen as default
right clin on the panel - add - gnome menu

Hi all, anyone had problems with ipv6 in very recent 4.4.0 kernels on 16.04?. I'm having an issue where my non-privacy address quits working after an indeterminate but short (maybe 5-10 minutes) time after bringing the interface up. Before this started it was working fine for over six months
@ I may be having that issue. Recently applied Ubuntu updates, and now my laptop won't mount a NAS file share on my network. Problem started right after the updates. It could be an IPv6 issue, maybe. I don't know what my problem is yet.
hmm OK that's something
@ also, if that's your name, we're probably distantly related (says Barry Tice).
Hahahaha could be, I know a Barry Tice but pretty sure it's not you ;).  are you using IPv6 to connect to the NAS?
Do you know the one who sails a lot of boats? Wisconsin, maybe, near the great lakes? I'm not him.
Yes. dang small world. That's my father
Yeah, I sometimes used to get his Yahoo mail.
oh... I think I know your email address ;)
I'd forward it. He has the underscore. I don't.
Sorry. I'm sure I've sent you stuff lol. anyway. Are you using IPv6 for the NAS?
Not intentionally. :-)
then probably that's not it
My fstab maps the NAS using ipV4.
and now it can't connect?
Right. I've been connecting to the NAS just fine for months and months. I applied Ubuntu updates two days ago, and now it won't connect. Another unupdated 16.04 box on the network mounts the NAS without issue, and both 16.04 boxes can ping each other. But, I cannot ping the NAS.
are you using samba?
Yes.
Hmmm, although if you can't even ping that's pretty strange.. Same subnet?. The other box can ping the NAS?. the other 16.04 box I mean
Same subnet, and yes, the other box can ping the NAS. Here's my fstab entries for it, if they're any help:. # NAS. //192.168.1.2/share /mnt/FileServer cifs username=guest,uid=1000 0 0. //192.168.1.2/usbdisk1 /mnt/USB cifs username=guest,uid=1000 0 0
the fstab doesn't really matter if you can't ping. Any firewall on the NAS?
None that I've configured. It's a pretty standard Buffalo NAS.. And, now I couldn't connect to it (at least from this box) to reconfigure if there is one.
there were some updates recently around the samba v1 security holes. I almost wonder if there's fail2ban on the NAS. and somehow that locked you out.  if you could change your IP address to another one on the same subnet and see if you could ping it that would be instructive. hang on. you should be able to do it without changing. Do you know how to configure an interface alias?.  so if you do ifconfig <interface>:0 192.168.1.200 (for example) and then ping -I 192.168.1.200 192.168.1.2, that should do the trick
@ no, I don't. But I take instruction well (even if the instruction is "Go read this man page").
of course make sure it's not an address already in use. so if it's enp1s0 then it's "ifconfig enp1s0:0 192.168.1.200/24". and then "ping -I 192.168.1.200 192.168.1.2". you'll need sudo for the first command
I'm not sure how to determine my interface. How do I tell if it's enp1s0?
if you do "ifconfig" you should see a list. one will have your current IP address of 192.168.1.X next to it
My ifconfig has an wlp3s0, so that would be it.
oh is it wireless?
Yes.
Ah ok. I've never seen a wlp name before. Anyway that's the one. so it would be ifconfig wlp3s0:0 etc
OK. I've done the ifconfig blah blah, and then ping blah blah listed above, and I still get Destination Host Unreachable.
how about "ip route get 192.168.1.2" ?
@. barry@barry-T430:~$ ip route get 192.168.1.2. 192.168.1.2 dev wlp3s0 src 192.168.1.65. cache
well... that looks kosher. And this computer is otherwise networking OK?. Is the other machine wireless as well?
Yes, and yes.
And the buffalo router is the nas... man something is really goofy
how can i solve this problem of compilation? http://pastebin.com/pj0SqbkP

i don't know what she did other than set everything to default (pulse) i think and she has no problems. !ru
strange..
she does have 8.04 not 8.10
and probably x32
yes
then i'll do it without any sound, I don't want to switch to x32
i warned her about 64 bits...i've seen a lot of people complaining
i am prime searching, my 4 cores always 100%, x32 is not string enough$
she doesn't do anything heavy..not needed
thanks anyway
what packages do i need to have installed ?
you do. what command did you use to mount it?
mate , you cant mount something that isnt in /dev/ and hda1 or hda2 are simply not there
didn't fdisk -l just show them?
it did, which puzzles me.
maybe it's a udev thing
"ls /dev/ | grep hda" gives me only /dev/hda
I've got a problem with gksudo, it doesn't ask for a password but comes up with "Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file". Anyone know any fixes for this (I've tried sudo -k)
chown youruser:youruser .Xauthority.  you will need to sudo that, I expect
Doesn't exist
it does : ~/.Xauthority.  it's in your home dir ( note the dot)
ls -a doesn't show it.  My bad, damn caps
ls -al ~/.Xauthority. it probably has root:root currently
done it, says it's mine, still nothing
ls -al .ICEauthority
also mine
and you still get that error?
Ya, anything to do with them being -rw-...
SWEET. gparted isnt opening.. guys. why is gparted such a brat.. SO many releases now gparted has been farting around to open properly
the app or the livecd?
the app. whether I open via gui, terminal, you name it.
what are you trying to do ?
well, I'm trying to open gparted....... that;s it. just open it.. I want to launch gparted and utilize it.. it seems to be random. I shouldnt have to use a livecd to format a flash drive. I just shouldnt
you can't resize or do much with it on the drive you're using , 
I really hate to sound like this, but what is it thats misunderstood? I'm trying to OPEN gparted. Period..  I know what I'm doing from there. I just need to open it.
didn't mean to insult your knowledge , but we get lots of ppl trying partiton a mounted disc. maybe purge gparted and reinstall it
I did purge it :(.  for some reason my mac isnt liking the fat flash drive I formatted with ubuntu's disk utility, so I wanted to try gparted for comparative reasons..  it opens fine on my other laptop. both are 11.10
why is my /bin/sh a link to /bin/dash?
that is the standard on ubuntu and debian. scripts are dash. user terminals are bash

yup
can you please tell me why? :0

hi all. i'm trying to setup permissions using setfacl in the cache folder of my webapp so that files created either by my user or the webserver can be written and deleted both by my user and the webserver. however, when the webserver creates a new file, getfacl overwrites some permissions and instead of having "rwx", there's a comment stating "#effective:r-x" - preventing me from deleting the file. anyone an idea. where the #effective part comes from?
what version of ubuntu are you using ?

How to detect ubuntu os is Desktop or server i'm used dpkg --list | grep ubuntu-desktop is there any better way to do this?
does not matter only diffrence is the set of defult packages.  and server normaly has no ui included
i know that but i'm making script to install ffmpeg & node.js so enduser can easily install this packages and as per ffmpeg guide they have some different packages for the server and desktop so i'm thinking to install only needed packages for the servers and desktop
the user cant run apt-get install ffmpeg?
we needed some custom features not all the features of ffmpeg so i needed those features only
will just do uname -a.  it will tell you if you have the sever or genrec kernel.  if you have unity there probly desktops
ubuntu server has generic-pae & desktop shows generic only
How do I improve the VNC performance over my network. I've simply enabled Desktop sharing and it's lagging alot.
what are you doing on the remote system?.  what OS is the client and the server?
Server is Ubuntu 13.10 and client is Win 7
what do you do on the remote system?
Server is Ubuntu 13.10 and client is Win 7
why do you connect using VNC? What do you do on the remote system?
No terminal access, just GUI atm..  It's just so I can manage it without having to be in the same building as it, it's over a gigabit network (With over 500mbps throughput) and it's performance is very poor.
manage in what way? Updates?
Updates, ensure Web server is still on..  And just generally change settings and config the machine - kind of just doing everything.
you can run updates using apt-get in a terminal. Youan check web pages are up by connecting to it from the windows pc..  all can be done over ssh, much faster
Of course, but i'd like to be able to remote into the desktop.

IceCrew, ruby, python, c?. IceCrew, well if you plan to submit packages to ubuntu, canonical prefers you submit python based packages
is python difficult?
IceCrew, not nearly as difficult as C. IceCrew, and in that case you just need the pythong gtk bindings
and you should give up call me IceCrew, one day he'll beat you up
hey what is a good program to use for writing c++?
dozens of IDE's and text editors out for that. !info geany | Haseo.  see 'geany'
Dr-Willis: yeah haha i was wondering if one stood out as the best. i saw a bunch

a little vague.. try geany i guess...
haha sorry about that. i took a look a geany. it looks perfect for my needs

Dumb question. I just built xchat 2.8.8 but I think is all in a folder on my desktop. Where should the folder be in the Ubuntu file structure?. I's like to move it
start over, use checkinstall this time. it will make a .deb package
>> Huh?. >> re-make it?
install the package called "checkinstall" and run it instead of "sudo make install" when you recompile it
>> sudo spt-get checkinstall?
sudo aptitude -y install checkinstall
>> What the heck is "sudo aptitude -y install checkinstall" doing in Intrepid?
what do you mean? that installs checkinstall
>> it is removing a ton of stuff
how can i find out what the heck is holding onto my audio card?
are you using Skype by any chance??
no
any other multimedia apps runing evan a web based audio plugin?
nope
onboard audio card or add in audio card?
onboard
only one audio card no addins aside from onboard?

I just use VNC.
if I remember correctly there is a build in one in ubuntu however I don't recall the name?
vinagre
I suppose I need to install this on the remote and on the client right?
along with iasha's problem,after I hibernate, I lose wifi capabilities. I don't have any of the graphics issues though.
is this on a macbook?
no, dell laptop
ah but that's a bit different. my issue is cross-OS, sleeps in one, resumes into a different one
that's an almost funny problem
I know :P. But I'm guessing the issue is somewhere on the boot record? idk, I have deactivated hibernation in Ubuntu, and on OS X it just does it by itself after a few hours on battery
i'm sure you can disable it in OSX as well.  but that's just a bandais
yeah that's the issue, if I don't use it for a few hours, I loose all my open tabs and stuff, I have to reboot it and work without internet
in the meantime though you can certainly disable hibernation in OSX and you can at least keep your work
no work is fine, it reopens automatically, but I usually have 100+ tabs or so open and I can't always open them when I'm away from home. but the bigger issue is that it does it in the first place
true...if you can't fix it right away you can always "System Preferences>Energy Saver. Adjust your settings. Set Computer to sleep to Never."
can somebody help me to install my video card ASUS ATI no just ATI

'o. 'im using screencloud and like it except it takes allways about 10%CPU. and sometime that's too much. idont use upload options nor check for updates
what cpu grunt do you have?
i have a intel core 2 duo 2Ghz. pavilion dv6 1330sf
10% is pretty reasonable, is it full screen?
no it does nothing : just waits for hotkey to call him for a screen capture. it should be 0% . (or about). imho
never going to happen, its high data to capture the screen in real tine and spit it to a file. Think about what is happening and the data size etc. Think about what is happening.  its a seriously data intensive action
yes i understand this during the capture. but the 10% is even when no capture is done
hi all. is it ok to delete /var/log/syslog?
jeez
?
not unless you have to
what happens if I delete it?
why do you want to remove the log file?.  you lose information about your system
thats OK, but it doesnt break anything if I delete it?. I want to remove it because it is 396MB big
repeat; why? :-)
^^
sounds like you maybe need 'logrotate' ?
so, is it OK to delete it?
Still trying to find my added games in the games menu. I tried the Main Menu editor but dont see anything. I tried enabling the Debian sub-menu but it keeps unchecking.
http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-add-entries-in-gnome-menu.html
ty checking that out.  404
ubuntu geek gives pretty decent advice.  google search for: add to gnome menu and hit i'm feeling lucky
ty. interesting that accessing it that way works better than from the System > Preferences > Main Menu item. that seems buggy.  i take it back. neither work. keeps unchecking Debian menu
weird.  i dont use metacity so couldnt comment personally
each window manager has it's own menu tree? I just want the stuff I install to show up in some menu :D
ok i got an issue after about 20 mins of running my ubuntu jsut stops screen goes black and the little white spinning thing is there it stops and i have to do a hard reboot any ideas, im new to ubuntu but not new to pc's
overheating?
its new pc dell 745 and vista runs ok on it
are there any PC-based oscilloscopes in kubuntu/ubuntu?
that might be a bit too specialized for this chatroom
where should i ask?
hmm... im failing =). i just wanna be able to /exec -o hddtemp /dev/hdb
you could add yourself to the group 'disk'.  that would be a security problem though, you'd be able to e.g. zero-write your disks accidently.
hawke u mean i could type wrong command for say like fdisk -and-fuck-it-up ?
exactly..  you could also add to /etc/sudoers:  root = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/hddtemp
hawke, can i create a script? that i can /exec -o to? and script does a sudo with password and voila?
the above-suggested method seems the best to me.
root ALL=(ALL) ALL this is all in my sudoers file in etc. and %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
How do I sandbox In ubunut?

Hi, i seem to be having a problem with Java. I have both Java Runtime and the Browser Plugin installed, but whenever i come across a site with Java in it Firefox says i dont have Java installed. Anyone know how to fix this?
<unconvertable> : Let's start by taking a look at things from Firefox's point of view.
ok, what do i do?
<unconvertable>  First, type about:config into firefox.
alright
<unconvertable>  In the filter, type plugin_expose_full_path or something like that.. <unconvertable>  When you find it, double click it to make it true.
i searched "plugin_expose_full_path" and got nothing
<unconvertable>  k, then just search for fullpath
its set to false
<unconvertable>  double click it to set to true
alright
ok i uninstalled apache but now when reinstalling it with apt-get i dont have apache2 in /etc. what can i do if i dont have a /etc/apache2?

I updated to 11.04 and my nvidia driver on my dell d630 won't work. I can get command line, but no GUI. anyone have ideas?
welcome to my world.... same here
NOO!!!!!. :).  did that work?
what?
what ActionParsnip suggested
I am trying to create and format a partition; gParted says that it is already in use by the system. It's not in fstab. How can I find out what's going on?
it might still be mounted somehow... have you tried using gparted from a livecd ? just my 2 cents. i'm pretty sure you can get gparted on a livecd, if not I know puppy linux has it by default. if it is, an ubuntu livecd would work for this too haha
Yes, I've used the live cd also. When I do that I can delete, create, and format the partition. After that I can reboot ubuntu, and the partition is there, and the ubuntu gparted recognizes the partition. I've installed the partition into fstab, but the next time I boot the partition is gone.
what's so special about xfs?
1 its very mature 2. its damn fast 3. we live in a multi media world now
i've read that you can corrupt it if you don't shutdown properly?
<unconvertable> does anyone know of a touchscreen calibration tool that works in Linux?. UNooble- how what is the signal strength?
the signal is around 50%, the same as in XP. I never had any problems there
hmm. you completely lose connection? or the download stops?
the thing is, it will be fine as long as im not downloading something with a lot of bandwidth, a torrent say, or running a big update. i lose connection completely, and i cant get it back unless i restart
that's wierd. sorry. <unconvertable> does anyone know of a touchscreen calibration tool that works in Linux?
It came to my attention that there is one that says: (hd1,2). Should I live it as it is ?
is that the windows one?
I don't know. It's in the first one
Is it normal to have to things listed underneath your wireless card (one called WLAN device, one called Unknown device)?
not to me
does this mean it doesn't recognize my card? Its a DWL-G520, supposedly supported by 6.10
if it is a wireless card, it looks like it is detected..  the unknown device is just theat unknown
okay. but the unkown device has grabbed the device name wifi0. So, when I try to set up my wifi in the networking app, it's setting it up for wifi0 (the unknown device)
does it just list the unknown device, or does it list other devices in iwconfig?
it lists two devices in iwconfig: the unknown one, and the WLAN one (wifi0 and ath0, respectively)
I'd try to work with the ath0 one then, and see what happens
Okay. I don't know how to set up the network using command line arguments, so I tried the networking connections tool.
are you using a encrypted network?
yes
ahh, well iwconfig is not hard to use, just man iwconfig.  you have to sudo the commands though
okay. I'll give it a try.
the problem could be the "password" thing you may have to type in the long code to get it working in linux
yeah, I've done that..  how do I attach the wireless networking extensions to the device? It says they are attached to the unknown device, but not the WLAN device.
humm, that is weird, I have no answer for it
okay. Do you know how to manually set the logical names? I would like to just switch the logical names and see if that helps.
humm interesting idea.  is this a PCcard, usb or what?
it's in a PCI slot.
I have a weird problem. My internal wireless network card is not found on every boot. It might show up if I reboot my machine - but not always. Is this a known bug ?. (In Dapper)
try adding pre-up sleep 5 to ifconfig
Add? How?
Find the part in /etc/network/interfaces for your card then add 'pre-up sleep 5' directly underneath it (will be something similar to 'iface ath0 inet dhcp' (won't work if you use network manager)
Ah, ok. What does it do ?
when i try to mount my external hdd (called "elements"), i get the error message "unable to mount elements - not authorized".. i'm using 10.4. i can mount it as root. when i go to properties, it seems te be owned by "root"

Is there a way to run X apps remotely from a windows XP machine?
I believe puTTY is for that
I can get puTTY to work for command line functions, but not for X apps
how are you accessing the cmd line?
ssh session
put ssh -X <user@address>.  put ssh -X <user@address>
it does not allow that. It starts up with a gui interface.
I'm just guessing with what I do with my Linux boxen
yup, got you.  me too
lol. doesnt it say on their site?
not really
useful...
I'm sure there is a way. It does have a place for a display location.  I have no idea what that means
i know my mum's laptop uses puTTY somewhere and she receives graphival apps across the internet. although they're both running Windows
Yeah, I can picture that working easily....but I need access to X apps on my Ubuntu box. I hate running XP, but my laptop will run nothing but or it overheats like crazy.
i use quanta plus with apache and when i save the quanta files i save them in /var/www/ and i was under the assumption that once that was done it would show up...ie i put in localhost and see nothing but the apache folder open it and all it says is " Its Working!" what am i doing wrong???
you'd need to check your apache conf
check it for what?
how do you find the network connection speed from a command line?
wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.28.tar.gz

in there it doesn't show anything but my wireless card that i had to activate. i need to update my video card
no, its used to access internet service trough a gsm network, like from a cellphone if you will, only from a computer
In the link you posted, it has step by step instructions on what to do
yes, but it says, that i have to download 3 packages, i can't access internet from ubuntu

hey all, still having trouble w/ lm-sensors - can't get it running. I just ran sensors-detect and that worked, but my next step isn't clear. I"m not getting output to xsensors yet, so I'm going to have to do something more, I think.
did sensors-detect tell you which modules to load?
i2c-nforce2, but I thought they were loaded by sensors-detect?
Do I *have* to have a greeter like lightdm. Can't I just login and run startx? In the past, doing this hasn't worked, because the greeter seems to have some interaction with dbus that makes sound not work. Anyone else experience this?
You can use xdm if you want..  and there's startx available..  install the xinit package if you want it
I don't really need a DM at all, but an undocumented dependency on dbus is a modest bug, IMO.
after upgrading to feisty, I cannot get flash to work in firefox...help please??

hi i just created a USB boot disk for windows, and it was done successfully, however near the end of the unetbootin installation, I read shortly something about the boot sector, then it finished. Im afraid the next boot will fail my current seup. s/seup/setup so how can one check the boot loader is still going to come up?. Ub12.04
boot up and run check disk for erros. then you'll know. *errors*
can i check while im on the pc now that grub should come up?. grub customizer is what i use now
nope. boot the usb. there error checking option is available once booted.
right, i mean the PCs grub i dont know if it got touched, and I have no other way to boot, its a USB based pc. so Im here now before that happens, finding a way to reinstall grub now.... Grub customizer works right?
i must have misunderstood. I thought you said you were making a usb and got some kind of grub messag at the end of creation. that would refer to the usb NOT to your installed system
ah precisely what i thought

how can i prevent memory leaks in ubuntu 14 server
you'll need to provide more detail. What application? Or is it system-wide perhaps? Basically, how do you know there's a memleak?
free99. it's minecraft is the only thing i have running
so it's running on... openjdk or something right? Sorry I don't know a lot about minecraft
system is a proliant server ml110 g6. yea. jdk headless
well... how do you know there's a leak? System eventually starts saying it's out of memory?
yes. looking at the logs. i see that a memory leak is detected before it has a kernal panic
if you can get some of the logs on pastebin I might be able to uncover something. make sure whatever you're pasting doesn't have sensitive info in it though. p.s. can someone help me with my kernel issue?
http://pastebin.com/WNmHyGLC. free99. there u go i took the last bit of the log
Lets start with the basics, you have a minecraft install from ubuntu repos or somewhere else?

Hello. How can I unmount a usb drive w/o losing the device node?
sudo umount /dev/sdz500, no?
and as user?
Uuuuuuh... Not sure how nautilus really mounts devices nowadays....  As far as I recall, right-click the device in Nautilus and choose "Unmount"
The context menu in Nautilus only offers something Id translate to eject and <unconvertable> remove safely.
Eh... Well... uh... Try them both and see which it is
Already did that. And then the device node /dev/sdX was gone..  In both cases.
Weird nautilus is weird. I suggest you use "pmount" to mount devices as an unpriveleged user, it seems to work nicely and at least makes sense
Is there a pumount command? I want to unmount it.
I am in the market for a new graphics card. i dual boot with windows to play games. Any recommendations? Nvidia or AMD?

Not really, I just use my computers for basic stuff.

still have issues with permitions at /var/www after add user to root and/or www-data group. is this the correct command to check folder users/groups ls -l /var/www
and did you log back in after adding yourself to www-data?
logout and back ip? no. in*
that recognises the group change
ok i will try that now thanks again
so you are still not in the groups you added ('groups' will confirm this)
i can see my self in those goups
can you post your groups output, and the output of ls -la /var/www to pastebin?
sure a sec. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 284 Jun 4 03:21 index.html. so must add user to root group right?
heeeelp. i get FATAL: Module snd_seq_oss not found.
I get that error too when typing "modprobe snd_seq_oss", that is normal
how can i get it working?
looks like you are using an old tutorial. What are exactly trying to do?
install tuxguitar
installing it or using it?
install then use.  if i start it i get /dev/sequencer: No such file or directory
I get the same error, its irrelevant. Could it be, that tuxguitar is working properly but you just don't get sound?
well, the whole point of tuxguitar is to get sound, otherwise it's useless, every once in a while instalation succeds and i get working sound but i don't know why it wont work now.  i'm pretty sure it has something to do with the missing modules
I dont think so, that issue is usual and also happens to me on every new computer. Start tuxguitar, go in the tuxguitar settings and tell me your settings under "Sound"
tuxguitar sequencer (should have real sequencer in there), midi through port (should have java sequencer in there)
"should have"? you are confusing me
when tuxguitar works, those options are available, the java sound sequencer is included in the installation files, if i run the exact same binaries in puppy linux the real time and java options are available
so you can't even start tuxguitar?
i can, but the sound doesn't work
so "tuxguitar-jsa" is installed? Under Midi Port I got the option "Gervill" (I think thats the java thing) which is working fine
gervill is not java sound sequencer.  and i don't even have gervil on my installation
so? I don't have any package called Gervill too, but it is working
i found gervil but if i run it i get error "midi system unavailable".  javax.sound.midi.MidiUnavailableException: Can not open line
what tuxguitar version are you using? would it be an option to you to run tuxguitar over wine?
i would rather not do that, in the past i've used timidity every once in a while but that lacks a lot of instruments

snd_hda_intel? It seems like there are issues a'plenty with that module.. At least I know _I_ have issues.
no, its a nvidia based laptop
The SOUND chip.

If it's an HD Audio, it'll be snd-hda-intel -- Intel made the HD Audio standard.

can anyone point me to a link on how to use ndswrapper on a wireless card?
^^
thanks 
np, I've spent the last 3 days getting my damned wireless usb device up and running... so lemme know if those aren't helpful
I have airlink that I have never had luck with on linux. it will show the wireless acess points, but never really conect
which one specifically?
it looks like a thumb driver. I will give you the serial number... .  AWLL3026
Have you tried looking up to see if theres a different driver for it?
It shows it on my network settings, how can I tell if it is connected?.  no, I am fairly new with linux
You say you can see wireless networks in your network settings?
wireless connection
The Ubuntu wiki page says it should work out of the box, so, you might want to make sure that when you open 'Network' you enable the wirless device, and disable all others.  'activate' rather
okay, so I will uncheck the wired connection and see if I get a connection
ok.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessNetworking <- this might help too if that doesn't work
test. yeah, didnt really work...  where did you see that it would work right out of the box?
see your PM
I can't see a pm
type /msg  test
I don't have a seperate window with you in there .  I am using xchat
In your Networking menu can you see any networks on the drop down list?
no.  No.  I assume you mean the ssid
Have you installed ndiswrapper? Yes I meant the ssid
I don't think so. I will try
how to install the software download from internet?
depends what it is
<unconvertable> is "mol(mac on linux"
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MacOnLinuxHowto
<unconvertable>  it said cannot found the "mol" package
Trying to get a SiS 82C204 to work right. Ubuntu's GDM won't start by default.. Detects everything perfectly though, just doesn't load
grep EE /var/log/XFree86.0.log
(EE) No devices detected..  which is odd because right above it it talks about the SiS card being hte primary device. ;0. (II) Primary Device is: PCI 00:0c:0. (--) Assigning device section with no busID to primary device. (EE) No devices detected.
I right-clicked a .iso and popped a CD-R in my burner, but "Write to Disc" states "No disc available, Please replace the disc with a supported CD or DVD." What could be wrong?
lewoco: Are you sure the drive is a burner, are you sure the medium wasn't already burned?
100% sure on both counts. I burnt a CD with the burner half an hour ago using media from the same reel as the current disc in the drive.
lewoco: do you have two drives (maybe it's looking at the other one?)
Only 1 CD drive
lewoco, bad CD?
I tried a second CD, no difference.
lewoco: there is space to write on the HDD (not that it should need it if you're burning an ISO)
hmm, I selected Brasero from the right-click menu instead of "Write to Disc...". The dialog that popped up looked the same, except that it now recognises the CD-R..  Probably just a bug.
Can anyone help me resolve unmet dependencies with gnome-panel?
what sort of issues?
. I've got no panels now. gnome-applets-data refuses to be installed, configured or removed. dpkg: error processing gnome-applets-data (--configure):. subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 139. Errors were encountered while processing:. gnome-applets-data
I'm doing an alternate install and my machine currently is text only. Will `apt-get install kde` get me up and running with X.Org?
yes, though suggest kubuntu-desktop instead
ok thanks. I'll try that instead.
how do i find out my driver version for my wireless card please. anyone
I'd recommend looking in System > Administration > Device Manager
Cheers . !  looking at the device manager tells me alot of information about my WUSB54g but I don't see a driver number??
When I hold either shift button or CTRL button and try to use my mouse to select multiple items in a list (in all applications), the mouse will freeze until i release the shift or CTRL key. So I can't select anything on the list. My system doesn't freeze, just the mouse. Suggestions?
check this, check to see if DOS emulation for USB is enabled. mine was and it messed everything up
where can I find that?
in the system BIOS.. has it always done this?
would that be the same as like enabling USB to work under DOS..like USB mouse/keyboard support for DOS/boot up stuff?.  Yeah it has but I think I turned that option on prior to installing once.. nano!
hi all. ubuntu vm will /etc/fstab in resume state.??. becoz facing issue in mounting network using /etc/fstab in vm resume. **mounting san. i am mounting san lun in my ubuntu VM using fstab, i halted the vm and started it, but i am unable to find the networkfolder
you need to remount it.  or throw it into automounter and have it mounted on demand
but /etc/fstab i mentioned the uuid and location
if it's a san mount. you're going to lose it when you suspend the vm and it comes down. resume won't remount it
ty what about NFS.?
you're going to have the same issue..  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Autofs
i need to do manually any option to automate.?.  ty dude. this is the one i am looking for
no problem
if i configure with autofs resume operation also it will mount, whenever i access it
it should..  obviously your network needs to be up and the host available
nice dude and ty.. host means SAN or NFS.?
suspending vm's can be wonky some times though. because the system doesn't really know it was suspended.. the san. you can't suspend. go somewhere else where the san isn't available, resume, and expect it to work
ok i will make a try.
is there a comand that show all mount drivers?
drivers or drives? to show all mounted drives "mount"
mount points
mount points are any directory on your system?
exacly, i mean i do a lot of mount -t cifs
can you make the launcher stay hidden by default? and only appear when you reach the edge/click ubuntu logo?
yes - if you install ccsm you can - there is a unity plug in that allows you to hide it by default
thanks 
Hello, good day, my speaker icon disapeared, and my running applications icon's disapeared also. Rythmbox used to be right there on the right corner of my apps, places, and system panel. but now gone
try right clicking on the panel and select "Add to panel" and add a Notification area
nothing
hmm.. it feels like such a cheap solution.. but have you tried rebooting?
yes..  also both my CPU'S are at 100% LOAD
can anyone please help me with my wifi issues. Since upgrading to 10.10 I have had it working temporarily. but it keeps coming and going.
on Netbook? whats your Wifi chip?
it has worked on this hardware fo the last few releases no problems without any special intervention, usually just works out the box.  yes netbook.....  Network controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8192E Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)
are you having Atheros? linux module ath9-? ?k?m ?
not sure what you mean?
type "lsmod" in terminal.  or "lsmod | grep ath"
no ath*
then it looks like a messy driver for wifi in 10.10 like the "ath9", what is your WiFi config? A, B, G?
hmm again, i am unsure what you mean by A, B, G sorry
you have Router with Wi-Fi or Access Point?
a router with WiFi (SKY).  its weird as it just worked 'out the box' with previous releases
if in apt-get install kubuntu-desktop will it keep all my settings icons etc.  you still there?
yeah
if i apt-get install kubuntu-desktop will kt keep all my icon settings etc.. or is it just better to wipe the partition out and start from kubuntu install ?
I think the kde preferences are mostly independant of the gnome ones
one think i like about gnome is that it has the TWO panels one on top one on bottom,, can i change KDE to do that?
I have a USB modem and it is well detected....how should i proceed to connect to ninternet.It is a Dial up
if you are on gnome, double click the network icon on the tray anda window will pop up. Select ppp connection from there and i suppose you know the rest
it is not showing there
does not show ppp connection?? what connections does it have?
its ppp
so you do have ppp! click on it and select Preferences from the button on the side
leavce that..suppose i am connected using wvdial and my connection get desconnected every10-20 sec or more and it get reconnected again..what will be the reason
will xubuntu work fine with an apache LAMP server?
of course
k. thanks
Anyone know a better method of speeding up HDDs apart from SSD cache or RAID 0?
dropping them from a 60 storey sky-scraper?
What a great idea. SSD cache documentation for bcache is frying my brain. Hence why I'm looking for other solutions
:) ... seriously, what kind of speed do you want that ssd can't provide? put them on a faster controller?
I want better speeds on HDDs but without buying SSDs. Mainly due to the cost difference as my budget is severely limited. Because I have a 128gb RAM machine but HDDs normally would completely die under the load
I have the same here
I use HDDs on a 72gb machine but fear 128gb would just be too far
Well, how about running some stuff from a ramdisk?
I could.. although thing is I ideally need to use all the RAM on the box.
clone the ramdisk from a HDD at boot... sync it back out at shutdown
A RAM disk though obviously uses RAM though doesn't it?
OK, well, fast controllers and multipath disks then
Yeah... As in different RAID options?. E.g. RAID 10?
If you want fast disks, but 10 disks in a stripe_mirror array on fast multi-path controllers
Hmm.. I wouldn't want quite as many as 10 disks as I could just buy SSDs then.. hmm. In reality I only need 2x 1tb hmm
Unless there is a lot of I/O going on, the kernel cache should be quite sufficient
Thing is, there is an awful lot of I/O going on. Lemme get some figures
well, the closer you can get it to the CPU, the better then... I return to ramdisk :).  sounds like you just need to get your head around bcache
Sounds like that to me too..
play with it in a virtual machine config
As in a normal virtual machine and just make multiple hard drives?.  Is this high read/write for a HDD? http://puu.sh/6ZKR9.png
is there anyone who knows about OpenVZ and virtualisation?. no.. I'm not interested about virtualbox. I want to know if I'll install OpenVZ it will be consequences.... about running well the others proccess from my PC
what was the question?.  what was the question?
unholy, sorry for delay. I want to know if I'll install openVZ on a desktop-ubuntu machine .... others proccess and jobs from it, will continue de run fine?
they will be separate.
I know..
what are you trying to accomplish?
openVZ will don't affect the rest of processes ?. I want to install openVZ to make some virtual machines, but I want to be sure this job doesn't affect the rest of apps which running on my PC
did you read what openVZ (and virtualization in general) is about?
I think yes.. I know the openVZ will virtualize the kernel
are any crucial ubuntu components in a.out format?
i highly doubt it. elf has been "the way" for like 7 or 8 years now
good, I guess I can disable that in my kernel :D
it's only a few k, not sure why you'd bother
so that I know if ever it really is important? :D
hello everyone ...is there any way to re-install evolution under ubuntu 10.04 LTS ???
sudo apt-get --reinstall install evolution
that will delete / rewrite all files, including config and so ???
No, your configs are stored in your home directory, APT won't touch them.  Just delete them if they're broken and let evolution recreate them
k, that's what I want ....cause i'm having troubles importing a pst file .... and I think reinstall may solve this .....hopefully ....
Probably not
what is tricky ...every 2 reinstallation of ubuntu evolution works without any problem .....  it did not change a single thing .......  i want to completely purge evolution from Gnome, then reboot, and after that install ...is that possible ???
Well sure, but.  It won't fix anything -_- Reinstalls never fix anything, unless there is some missing file
Ok, but how come 3 months ago I've imported pst with no problem and now I cannt ?
What is the term for text files with commands in it, just "scripts"? How do I google it for details etc.?. What is the term for text files with commands in it, just "scripts"? How do I google it for details etc.?
I usually find that searching 'bash' gets me in the right places when talking about scripts..  i.e. 'bash' in addition to whatever else you're looking for
Ok, thank you .. Also, I am trying to apt-get something and am getting E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?. ?
Hi folks! why Ubuntu does not recognize my flush memory?
how are you plugging in the flash memory?
I just insert into the USB drive, and for some reason doesn't recognize it.
Does anyone have any experience with Deja Dup?
I have some experiences with it, yes.
I'm trying to restore a backup, but it seems to have gotten stuck on "checking for backups"... Either that or I'm being impatient
Hmm. Run htop, see if it's acting up..  This never occured to me. It's very straightforward app.
'htop'?
htop, or Run "ps -aux | grep deja" -- Whatever the dejadup command is.
Ok... What am I looking for?
See if RAM or CPU is really high, that's it..  Are you trying to restore a large backup? If so, that may be the reason.
Doesn't seem so, no
How long have it been?
I'd say... about 25 minutes
Okay. Clearly something happened. It shouldn't really take that long. Different versions?
Nope, same version. I just did a reinstall
How do I determine what version of usb ports (version 1 or 2) I have available on my computer?
lsmod | grep hci.  if that lists ehci, you're using 2.0
and if it shows nothing I run 1.1?
to install apache+php+mysql in 12.10 i just need to type sudo apt-get install lamp-server^ right?
that should work
it says it couldn't find the package lamp-server.  this is a new install, to you think an update of the repository is needed?
is there a way to reverse latest command I did ?
what was it?
chroot /home /bin/bash. seems that everything is screwed I can't run any command. They are all unknown
motherboard claims "SATA II"-- lspci shows " IDE interface: nVidia Corporation MCP61 SATA Controller" is this real SATA device or some kind of bridge?
real
I was expecting some reference to AHCI but his seems to be connected via IDE
I'm using 11.10 and when I adjust the terminal font to 9, I get strange artefacts when typing (like characters aren displayed properly or the last charcter shows up when pressing space
using a monospaced font, right?
yes. on my other vm with 11.10 its no problem though
what do you have set as the system-wde monospace font?. *wide
where can I see that?
what do I need to do so that the services on my machine are available to the home network when the machine is booted and I am not logged in?
what services?
I have the family calendar on my machine (.ics files).  everything works fine if I am logged in. I think I just need to have the wireless start on boot. But I don't know how to do that.
you would want to edit your IP table to allow connections from your local network ie: 192.168.x.x and also have the apps loaded into the /etc/init.d or the umm... startup file which i forgot the name of.  the script is /etc/rc.local
thats sounds right. So, I'll read up on init.d, that a start.
that loads apps before you log in.. so it can run your wifi and your calender prog. !rs
Ah, that sounds right. (I am returning to *nix after hmm 16 years )
Hey everyone, I've had video problems with linux whenever I've used it, xv crashes my system forcing a hard reboot, and I was never able to keep totem from using it. I switched to mplayer with great success, except that it won't play any audio on quicktime files. I'm willing to try anything :). Thunderbird?. Can anyone help me with my video problem?
your video isnt working
Video is working, rather, I have a problem running quicktime videos: there's no audio
mplayer?
Mplayer..  I tried totem, but I can't stop it from using xv which causes a hard lockup on my system
grab the latest mplayer from source along with the latest codecs
alright
also see if you have any audio playing a dvd, etc.. using mplayer
avi and wmv and mpegs and some quicktimes work fine.  just the newer quicktimes that don't have audio

can i preserve environment variables set in a bash script and pipe the variables to another command?. $bash -C "/path/to/env.sh; echo $variable;". how can i accomplish this?. env.sh would set $variable
export variable.  without the $ sign.
yeah i tried that
Oh. You mean from a script!.  I get it..  You can't. However, if you can run the script in the current shell: . /patch/to/env.sh
yeah the bash file contains 'export THIS_VARIABLE="value"'
Or, well, source /path/to/env.sh
:-/
Instead of running it.
so bash -C "source /path/to/env.sh; echo $THIS_VARIABLE"
Yup.
hmm. thx.  it does not work
http://bpaste.net/show/gZD1igrpl10nPWq5Y3eJ/

we told you when you first asked. yes, since 12.04
but i can't make a live USB on a mac, how can i do it?.  i tried the latest version, but it does not show up on booting
and did you download the mac ISOs? what kind of mac do you have?
i got the ISO from the Ubuntu website, i am not sure if there is a special ISO for mac, my mac is firmware 8,1 macbookpro 2012 and i have OS X 10.9.3

I've got a friend here with an 8800GTS -- I got the driver to install okay, and it boots without the black screen of death, but he's getting a max screen resolution of 800x600 on a 1400x900 widescreen monitor...does anyone know how I can fix this?
your friend needs to tell ubuntu to set the resolution by his monitor.  it's there in screens and graphics under adimerstration
I've tried changing his monitor to the correct resolution in that, and it works for the login screen, but as soon as he actually logs back on it reverts back to the old 800x600..
well did tell ubuntu to work the correct version of his monitor.  also is you are using the non-restricted drivers that might be the main problem. if*
I'm using the 9.* driver installed by Envy =\
hello, how can I force ubuntu to search for new devices connected to it?. (hot plugged dvd-rom)
it should do it on plug in.  it should do it when you plug it in, IF the motherboard supports hot plug
it does support hot plug (ahci) but ubuntu is not showing it
ahci doesn't mean it's hot plug, that's just one option
weird if I hot plug a hard drive it does mount it automaticaly
does your dvd drive have a disk in it
yeap
is the dvd drive hot plug supported
?.?. no clue, how can I know that?
is there a way to install java 9 from oracle automatically using a shell script without keystrokes - http://tipsonubuntu.com/2016/07/31/install-oracle-java-8-9-ubuntu-16-04-linux-mint-18/. Seems like oracle pops up a license box to press enter on - perhaps someone knows how to automate this?. These two lines are asking for user input---> apt-get -y install oracle-java9-installer , update-alternatives --config java
https://askubuntu.com/questions/929932/automate-keystroke-enter-in-curses-with-command-from-bash/930697.  but never tried

anyone here use Squirrel Mail ?
yes. got it working here
could you offer any advice on how to secure it..?
with ssl - I've found it very good
especially flood controls, etc
not had much in the way of flooding, but overall, not had a problem
alright thanks i will look into it
onething to keep in mind is your maildir format on the imap server squirrel mail is fussy
what do you mean?
check the squirrelmail help but maildir and maildir++ and things like that effect its behaviour, as does the imap server
ok.  would you mind quickly explaining how to enable ssl for squirrelmail
well, there is 2 points, ssl on the imap server and ssl on the apache server, its not really squirrelmail
oh well they both have ssl already. i use webmin which runs with https
ok - so when you configure squirrelmail just tell it to use ssl.  and make sure your ssl domain for webmail is using ssl
thats the part i dont know how to do
which bit
how do you force it to use https://site.com/squirrelmail

if i want to use files on bchunk which are on the desktop, what shall i do, "sudo bchunk 'desktop' klockren-xpsp2.bin klockren-xpsp2.cue klockren-xpsp2" or wtf???
No need for sudo.  But seriously, if you run just bchunk, you should get quite a lot of output
i did, it did NOT make any sense, since i've never found out how to figure out the directories in terminal
Will all apps that work on Ubuntu also work on Ubuntu Touch? And if not yet, is that what the new package format will be all about?
not all, but most, technically
Like Kdenlive for video editing and pavucontrol and ffmpeg, stuff like that?
what format are you talking about, though? :)
The new Ubuntu package format coming out for 13.10 touch and 14.10 desktop.
the primary limiting factor will be things that aren't readily built on arm.  which is called?

Hello, I have a hard drive in my fstab that will not always be present at boot, When it is not present the startup halts and waits for the press of the 'S' key to skip the mounting process of the drive. Is there a way to get it to default bypass?. Hello, I have a hard drive in my fstab that will not always be present at boot, When it. is not present the startup halts and waits for the press of the 'S' key to skip the. mounting process of the drive.

keyword: noauto (in fstab)
noauto is going to allow auto bypass at boot ?
I've got an encrypted home directory on one computer, and want to be able to access it via NFS on another computer, but all I see is the "Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop" and "README.txt" files. How do I view the ecryptfs files with nfs?
I'm thinking that the user whose homedir that is has to be logged in for the files to be accessible.
I am
Hm, I was pretty sure they got mounted on login.
In fact, that's where I'm running this chat from. sftp works just fine..  They get mounted, but as a FUSE filesystem. The nfs-kernel-server doesn't read it.
Can root see the files? True on my system.
Yes, but not nfs
Oh, no idea then, sorry.
I'm thinking I need to install a userspace NFS server....
evening everyone. I'm trying to package some software for distribution and am following this guide: http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/packaging-new-software.html
what kind of softwar?
section 4.2 assumes I have a tarball but I grabbed the source from github
that whoel guide is out of date, i believe
this: https://github.com/emc2foundation/einsteinium
bzr isn't used anymore
oh. is there a more updated version?
https://github.com/emc2foundation/einsteinium/releases.  that's the tarball -^
oh... ok. let me try it with the url then
well, i mea, that's where tarballs are.  read about debian/watch and how to specify github urls
but if this is outdated, there's nothing more updated because this seems like the official version

heey i hv prob ihv deleted the oem accoun by chance and now am not able to login with this account agian i tried to create it again but it gives me error message. how can i backup it i hv the /home/oem folder i want create user with that /home/oem how can i do that ?
boot the desktop cd and mount your OS as the partition, then type passwd to change the root password
u mean the alternate cd ?
how do i create a new env var. The question may be trivial but i can't find a concrete answer on the net
it depends on which environment the variable needs to be set -- shells? All users? Just one user? Gnome?
all users, i've ssh'd into a test server. as root
so it needs to be set system wide in all shells?
yes
I wonder why I get no desktop sounds?
do you get any sound?
> I do, yeah...
System->Preferences->Sound might help

I am having troubles with apt-cacher-ng... specifically it's avoiding the proxy specified in Acquire::http::Proxy on the client.
Change the URLs in the clients sources.list to specifically use the apt-cacher-ng server.

Chaneg the URLs and dont use Acquire::http::Proxy on the client.

if i have an laptop with a CRT plugged into into vga port can... can i have a different refresh rate for the CRT ? how?
refresh rate? Or resolution?
refresh rate
what video chip?
its 60hz for the laptop lcd which is too low for a crt ... ie it hurts to look at... its using the savage Xorg driver
is the CRT a clone of the lcd, or a different screen?
clone of crt ..... cone of lcd on crt i mean
Anyone know how to lock an refreshrate?
all refresh rates are effectively locked. the only time the refresh rate is computed on the fly is if _all_ the modes in your xorg.conf file are invalid.  if all are invalid, it will choose from a small group of defaults.
ok, I have refreshrate 85 on 800x600 and I can hace alot more

you use the latest ubuntu, right? It has systemd instead of upstart. Try to find a way to migrate the daemon.

in that case, write a bugreport to the developer saying "software doesn't support systemd".  if they are still actively working on this, you will probably get your fix.

is there a way to force a reinstall of a package and all of its dependencies ?
synaptic (therefore apt-get as well) allows reinstall but i do not think it reinstalls dependencies as well
yeah.. you can add the --reinstall switch to apt-get.. but i think there is something wrong with the dependencies... i can no longer view pdfs with either acroread or evince
if you want to reinstall - i think you will need to march thru them yourself :(
:( that sucks... but i guess i will have to try it

yeah.. the power button doesn't work either (unless i hold it down) im guessing its an HID problem.  they work fine in Intrepid. (on it now)
disable ACPI or is it APIC during install.
will try..

Rollitup: try changing your DNS server.. Rollitup: echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null. Rollitup: then try again. Or does the name get resolved to an IP and it's the actual ping failing?

what about System > Administration > Hardware ? Does that work?. hardware drivers*
it just says "No proprietary drivers are in use on this system"
ah, most times that will start the hardware app
what do you mean?
the one you were talking about 
in the image for this machine i installed nvidia-93 manually.  then i removed it now.  before the last reboot
93? thats a bit new for your card
maybe that's what's causing this problem?.  -96 i mean.  i should be using -71 instead?
I have a wireless network issue that was working - my card won't locate any wireless networks. iwlist wlan0 scan doesn't find any
try with sudo
it's not a permission issue. same result
i would appreciate some help in how to create a bootable floppy to upgrade bios
as far as i know you may only be able to do that in windows unless your bios manufacturer provided linux files to create or run a bios update. this isn't anything ubuntu/linux has control over sadly

link me those tutorials i would like to look them over. a bios update is vendor specific (hp,dell, or mobo manufacturer) so it should be an interesting trick if someone has a workaround

it does, I just don't know how to use it, it's more commonly used to be served from web servers. Although I know you can run it from the command line. I just don't know how.

then just set the DISPLAY variable to the running X server.

Hey guys, Im trying to install Ubuntu on my PC here but on every CD I try i get a bunch of errors along the lines of "Buffer i/o something something SR0" and then it quits with a kernal panic.. what do I do !?.  Sorry the error stated SR0 not HDA1.. that was a mistake :)
- that makes a difference. it would seem to suggest that something is wrong or not cooperating with your cd drive.  -- can you boot into and OS and use the cd drive without problems?
No sir.. I tried the live and alternate CD and both give me these errors when i select either install or boot from CD.  But when I use the CD drive in windows there are no problems at all
- ok - that's what I was looking for - confirmation that the drive works. Did you try burning the cd at a slower speed? I've run into that once or twice, and that 'fixed' it for me...
I have burned it at 8x 4x and even 1x.. all the same problems
- whoa - you're way ahead of me :) That's strange indeed. Are you burning it on the same drive you're reading it from?
No im not. Because for some reason the drive im burning it with does not see the disk as boot disk. So i had to swap it into a DVD drive to boot
- can you swap drives around to try booting the cd from a different one?
Due to powercable shortage i can only have 1 drive on at the same time. So its either the CD-RW drive or DVD drive. When i hook up the CD-RW drive it will not boot into CD at all
- interesting. Are you reseting the jumpers on the back of the drives when you switch them around?
Not at all
- just double check those -- depending on their configuration they may be set to master/slave/cable select and that (maybe?) is causing troubles?
What would you recommend ?.  Keep both of them on cable select ?

System-Preferences-Startup Applications . this is one.
do u know anything about the hda-analyzer.diff file? do u think i can make it load upon start up
I am not familiar with that . but as you want to load it upon startup . there are some approach ..  you can write to the /etc/rc.local
because if anyone has any experience in hda analyzer they all know that all the settings will vanish after restart.  i can put the .diff file in their?
you can look that file ,you edit it and write some commands there for the os to run upon startup
yeh but the .diff file has alot of stuff in it lol.. do u need to put any option lines or anything like that in their?
at your case ,maybe you can edit a "patch"command for the .diff file
Know any Patch commands?. !patch
I though , it is one configuration file that will change every time you restart , isn't it? then how about the .diff file .It is diff original-configuration present-configuration?
yes everytime u restart the settings go back to normal but i do believe the .diff file stays the same
Hey everyone, I have a smb question if anyone has time. I have a Ubuntu server that runs an SMB server on my network. It uses security = USER which should make it use system accounts for auth. I recently changed my main account's linux password and now I can't log into samba anymore. I can still log in with another account that I did not change the password for. Is there anyway to flush or reset SMB? I tried searching around but couldn't
did you change your linux user's password or samba password?
Linux user's. I can log in with the user via ssh & other services that use the account password but not through samba..  I tried restarting the service and restarting the server.

Hey, anyone know what I can do to investigate this problem? My friend's new laptop (Thinkpad x220i) running Ubuntu 11.04 keeps freezing. Complete freeze, has to be hard-reset. Seems to be random, nothing in particular seeming to cause it.
have you checked harddisk/ram?
I ran memtest and it seemed to freeze immediately. It's not like it started testing memory and then froze, it's just frozen as soon as it comes up. Needed a hard reset..  Have not checked hd
memtest from boot-menu? ... sounds like broken ram or or board to me
Yeah

foo.com is behind a firewall that blocks ICMP? also, the firewall might be blocking port 22 for ssh or is behind a NAT with no forwarding setup.
terminus... thanks... are these issues that need to be resolved on foo.com, or the network?
I'm working on Wine's installation script, and it uses su, but ubuntu doesn't play well with that. I'd like to run sudo, but other systems don't play well with that. Is there an environment variable that says whether a system has a root user? That way, I could check it and then determine which one to run.
what it needs is distro detection.  you can find out if a sysem is ubuntu by looking in /etc/lsb-release
But aren't there other, non-ubuntu distros that get rid of the root user? I'd like to not have to make a hack for each one.
What does ctrl-T do in the command line?
not a whole lot it seems
well, i just wanted to make sure it hasn't actually done anything. because i'm copying a lot of important files. that i can't afford to lose. (i accidently hit ctrl-T while they're copying, (cp is running))
if you have stock keyboard shortcut settings, you should be fine. doesn't look like it's set up. shift+ctrl+T = new tab
i'm more worried about something like ctrl-C
How can I have a cpu-processor temp in my gnome panel like an applet or something?

hey guys. to partition off a drive after the OS is installed so that the main stuff is on one part of the HDD and the rest of the free space is used for data, what steps are required? just partition it in gparted and done? or is there something else involved?. I suppose it would functionally be like this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition/ExtendedPartition
what did you do so far? installed to x GB?
nothing at this point. right now this is for research purposes.
Fevix: yes you really want to format / in that case.  what scenario would you be in where you'd only setup things partially from install though?
to provide more background, I am going to be using greyhole for storage pooling, but the unit where I am installing my OS to only has 4 drive bays. I would like to make the most of those bays. So I would like take the 1TB drive the OS is currently installed on, shrink the OS partition down to something like 60-100GB, then use the remaining free space for the storage pool..  sorry, dropped out of the room for a sec. did you see what I typed?
could someone help me get sound working again after a recent update?
whats the problem?
no sound
lots of my packages of faling to d/load, should I be worried :)
you have to be realy patient when downloading. It will start eventualy
did your packages fail though,
no they didn't fail. But it got stuck at 66% for a few minutes.
mine are actually failing, Connection failed [IP: 82.211.81.151 80] ? ?
Hey.. I can't get java to work on Firefox. both installing it from the tarball and Synaptic.
enable the extra repost and install sun-java6-jre from backborp. backport

in ubuntu always try synaptic and apt-get first
I tried Synaptic.. It didn't work. :/

what makes you think your graphics card is not being recognised
because it says so with every startup
madwifi-hal driver no workie, should ath_pci or ath_hal be blacklisted?
that seems to be normal behaviour. a second wifi card would get a second wireless caption with a own list of ssids
the second wifi card has been removed.  right now I just want to go back to what previously worked, namely the madwifi-hal drivers.
if you have tow, their names are shown. if you have only one, its name is hidden
when I plug in the usb it shows 2 devices, but neither of them is the ath/madwifi that is onboard, nor do either of them work.  it shows a list of ssids, but the boxes that should show connection strength are all empty
I was runing some regular update and after reboot my screen went to hell! i got some twisted picture... is it possible to run installed ubuntu in some safe grafic mode, so i could try to fix the grafic ore something???
why not just strip the splash altogether
i don't know what is that but please tell me how and i will do it :D
I mean, just have no graphic, you will get all of the text rolling by but you will be able to see some progress and such if that is your purpose
i don't think i get you very well. my purpose is to fix my ubuntu desktop to can work on it, now is some twisted line grafics ...
but the graphic problem is just the little boot graphic right?
the problem starts since the login screen appears and further when i login too picture is twisted
oh I see, your initial question was unclear. You must have problems with your X configuration.  not sure how ubuntu is dealing with that these days, you could edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf though
i don't have a clue idea what happened, but after normal ubuntu update the picture went to hell
what updated
dunno it showed it has update from ubuntu
quick question, when dual booting, how do i access my windows partition with ubuntu, i'm used to other deb based distros and kde, where my partition was on the desktop, i couldn't seem to find out how to jump to my windass partition in ubuntu, can it be done in gnome and ubuntu?
You'll want to see if you have the NTFS filesystem module installed (I'm on a Windows laptop at the moment, so can't check)..  cat /proc/cpuinfo. whoops, make that /proc/filesystems
k..but i don't need ntfs, just fat 32
Oh, perfect.  Windows on the first partition?
yup. it was my only real prob with it
ok... i have just switched to ubuntu and i installed the 64-bit feisty fawn version on my amd athlon 64 , kv-8 pro MB computer. i tried installing wine with get-apt and then with source. both times i ran it, the program froze and i had to restart the comp. so i thot, y not just use 32-bit ubuntu. so i installed 32-bit ubuntu and installed wine the easier way (through add/remove programs). again it stalled the computer. and i had to restart. something is very much wrong. sorry for length of this...
go to the winehq.org site follow the links to dl the latest ubuntu version, about half way down the insctructions page there are special instructions for hte 64 bit versiion
i have done that already pelo. it stalled on startup. and i now have 32-bit ubuntu anyway
Hi!. Is there any way to get the sound working on a dual screen setup (the second monitor is connected through hdmi and should play the sound)
pulseaudio should be able to handle that. just choose the output device accordingly
thanks i'll try
so google tells me it is pointless to set up a raid0 enviroment for my dektop. any comments on RAID
what do you want to know?
is there any performance increase for a desktop
you're going to hate me, but depends. which raid configuration are you looking at
y would i hate you? what does it depend on?
a lot, thats the problem. Depends on the raid configuration you use, the hardware you have, the speeds of the slowest hard drive
i was going with software RAID0
How can I load a kernel driver?

any idea why my firefox is causing my system to freeze?

the freezing isn't though -- try disabling all plugins/extensions.  usually it's flash that causes hangs
ah! now you're thinkin' with gas

hi, im trying to understand GTK... what files do i need to use it? im running fluxbox right now.. anyone here today?
what do you mean "use" it? Write programs that use GTK? Run GTK programs??
i mean to change themes and such...
and you don't have GNOME installed?
yes i have, but im using fluxbox... do i have to use gnome?
how can i change gmd theme in karmic. ??

Then there is no way to change gdm theme???
I have a mythbuntu box that keeps crashing every few days. There is no display, no response for keyboard/mouse, it doesn't accept ssh or vnc connections, and the lights on the keyboard flash on and off. Tried memtest, 5 passes, no errors. Any ideas? Is there a log I can check?
if the keyboard lights are flasing its a kernel crash. so the system is dead and no more network
is there a log I can look at to see why it happened?
/var/log/messages, though i am not sure it has the actual kernel crash
I looked there, and it shows all of the startup activity from the reboot, but not the actual crash.  Is there any established way to go about troubleshooting this?
maybe the log file was just rotated at the time of reboot, so might have to go back one step in history. just ls -al /var/log/ you will find it
I'll look...
i would say that the display shows a kernel dump, pictures of kernel dumps are ok nowaways.  mythbuntu channel can give you more hints on which log files to check
not sure I understand what you are saying about a kernel dump.
Hello again. I installed a Apache server to my Ubuntu, everything is working pretty good, however I wonder what should I do in order to access the computer using a human name like "webserver" thatn writing 192.168.1.x ??
has your system a name already?.  the machine apache is running on, I mean
yes it does, the name is "LinuxServer"
if you "ping LinuxServer" .. does that work?
ping: unknown host LinuxServer
ok, first of all you need to make an entry in your /etc/hosts file
I have never done that, I beg your batience, can you help me on that?
add a line like this like this: "192.168.1.33 LinuxServer", where the 33 should be your real ip part...
ok, I am trying
sure, use "sudo gedit /etc/hosts" to open the file
ok, done, so I guess I have to restart my networking right?
nope, ping should work now
no it is not
. Ok. Can you ping 192.168.1.x address you said you use?
yes I can, I installed a Apache server to my Ubuntu, everything is working pretty good, however I wonder what should I do in order to access the computer using a human name like "webserver" thatn writing 192.168.1.x ??
i know
sorry, something qrong with the copy/paste.  cmrabet@CM-Laptop:~$ ping 10.10.10.210. PING 10.10.10.210 (10.10.10.210) 56(84) bytes of data.
ok that works?
Iyes, when pinging to the numbered IP it works
ok then you need to put *that* 10.10.10.210 address in /etc/hosts
http://pastebin.com/m6a153571 that's my hosts file
ok, moment.  ok. First of all, you have a double entry in the /etc/hosts for LinuxServer..  oh, 1 moment.  before you were not able to ping "linuxserver" ? Because before it was on your 127.0.1.1.  let's take one step back :) Edit /etc/hosts and put an "#" before your line starting with 10.10 ...
so shall I delete that line? mas.msft is our domain here
well, that one should work. So disable your 10.10.xxx first by inserting # before that line
I have done it, but still the same result, Don't you thinkg that I have to restart the netwroking in my server?
no, that's not necessary.  type "ping 127.0.1.1"
from the server?
yes
pinigint to 127.0.1.1 I get pong
are you talking about more than 1 machine?
yes, I am now in a desktop machine controling the server throught shh
ah.. that explains
so from the desktop machin when I try to do this: ping LinuxServer it doesn't work
I was playing with compiz settings via the CCSM program. I accidentally tweaked it to make every transparent. How do I reset it?

Hello. Can Rhythmbox have gapless playback?
Yes
?
Check edit: preferences: playback: enable crossfade backend
that's not gapless.
Yes it is, check Rhythmbox docs.  I had the exact same reaction as you, but I read up on it and tadaa, gapless playback
roger. Thanks..  not quite gapless, but closer.
Then it's most likely a problem with the tracks themselves. Most of my music plays back with flawless gapless
when played through my iPod it is perfect.
Is using apt-build a good thing?
Everything will be building from source constantly, like in a Gentoo system. If you can afford the cpu and bandwidth it's not so horrible.

hi all, what could be the matter with compiz not workin on 8.04 Hardy heron, worked fine until like 3 days ago :(

hmm, where did you get that plugin from??
guys, my wife was watching a movie on her account just now, when computer rebooted. I check syslog, and last message before it came online, seems to be: Jan 13 13:55:50 genadi-deskubuntu gnome-screensaver-dialog: pam_ecryptfs: seteuid error. there is also earlier errors when she started watching: Jan 13 13:28:30 genadi-deskubuntu NetworkManager[747]: <warn> error requesting auth for org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.wifi.share.open: (3) GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NameHasNoOwner: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NameHasNoOwner: Could not get UID of name ':1.171': no such name
That looks like some process didn't correctly parse a user ID and resulted in a bad string. Not sure about the previous pam_ecryptfs error.  See bug #1085706
those couldnt cause a system to halt/reboot?
Unlikely; I'd suspect an over-temperature issue if it just dies without warning
hmm, you remember off-head the command to see sensors data?
video decoding can often stress the system that way. lm-sensors is the base package for monitoring, and there are various GUI applications and task-tray applets for seeing/logging the values.  I use "Psensor" as a task-tray applet to view the output
I am on ssh remote controlling, installing the package automatically adds the task-tray?. I am not sure which of the sensors in "sensors" output, is the CPU sensor.. its not stated.
There can often be multiple entries for the same sensor, accessed using different methods (ACPI, direct).  "sensors" should list "core" temperatures, one per CPU core
http://paste.ubuntu.com/6744660/ this is what I have
I'd guess temp1 and temp2 are the core temperatures... Does the PC have a dual-core CPU?
it has a Phenom II, quad core
Hmmm... did you run sensors-detect ?
dont remember :) have the package for a long time, sec
Unless there are only 2 thermistor sensors in the Phenom... but on both a 6-core and 4-core Phenom here I'm positive I've seen each core reporting a temperature
I did a full scan, but the output has not changed.. and turns out I do have in /etc/modules: it87 - was auto added back in May 26th
Strange... and I can't check the Phenoms here right now to compare notes, unfortunately
shame.. ah wel - another time maybe. pm me if and when you get a phenom nearby :). thanks for trying !
OK, hang on, I've searched a bit. I've found an example sensors config that suggests temp1 is the "system" temperature and temp2 is the "CPU casing" temperature.
hmm, system - meaning CPU?
Your guess is as good as mine!
lol. well, how do I make it save high tempratures into log file at least? if it ever reboots again because of that, I will know :)
There is a package called "sensord" that will log temperatures.  "sudo apt-get install sensord" then "sudo sed -i 's/#LOG_INTERVAL=30m/LOG_INTERVAL=1m/' /etc/default/sensord" then "sudo service sensord restart"
thanks, you sure that sed command is correct? everything in /etc/default/sensord seems commented out with # prefixed
Did I mistype!?
I am not specialized in sed, so I am not sure :) only uncommented line actually is SYSLOG_FACILITY=daemon
This works: "sudo sed -i 's/#LOG_INTERVAL=30m/LOG_INTERVAL=1m/' /etc/default/sensord"
what is it supposed to do? where should the log be? # RRD_FILE=/var/log/sensord.rrd
If in doubt edit the file manually "sudo vim /etc/default/sensord" or use a GUI editor with something like "gksudo gedit /etc/default/sensord".  "daemon" facility is default and the output goes to "/var/log/syslog".  By setting the interval to 1 minute you're going to have a pretty accurate trace of temperatures if it does fail again
ahh, got it  :) thanks! hmm how do I prevent the report of voltage into the syslog? to prevent overspamming
I get " shm.c: mmap() failed: Cannot allocate memory" all the time when using pidgin.. anyone else seen this?
Have you checked for similar bugs on Launchpad?
I say something that talked about gstreamer.  but I am not playing any video or audio
how do i make a launcher do more than one command?
add a ";" between commands
so "cd ~/jUploadr-1.1.2-linux-i386; ./jUploadr" should work?.  or can i simplify that?
you could put those commands into a shell script and point the launcher to that
how?
try that combination first before getting into shell scripts, we'll see about later if you heva trouble starting Jloadr deal ?
deal
okay, does it start ?
"Failed to execute child" process "cd" (no such file or directory)"
just to check if i'm with you .. you're trying to run JUploadr from a menu ?
a launcher that i made on the desktop.  a launcher that i made on the desktop
i see, you'll need to re-check your paths in the launcher commands
the paths are golden.

Hi all, i lost my eth2 device (used for drbd sync) 4 times in a day time. Any idea why i lose my interface ?. Running 12.04 LTS ubuntu server
Start by identifying your problems specifically and looking around for bugs in your driver module and then possibly your init system. That's where I would start personally.  Also look in dmesg. It may reveal some information about what's going on.  Also any recent updates
dmseg only states that the link went down. And drivers i suspected as well, looking for some others..  Freshly installed server
does it start at eth0 then go to eth2?
0-3 =)
hmm. Did you change your hostname and reboot since it changed
Where eth0 and 1 have aliasses, and are bonded (bond0 and bond1).  IT had it from the start
if i ping google why nameservers answer coming from having weird names like tz-in-f104.1e100.net, can't google have one google.com to not confuse?

i need to reinstall(and purge) all apport related packages and dependancys. can that be done via aptitude --purge reinstall , in some way?.
why do you need to do this?
reinstall command gets around dependancy "issues" when you just want to reinstall something with fresh cfg files.
how can i tell a program to open in a certain size?
does the program in question provides commandline switches to do that ?
a terminal eg. it always opens in a really small size, starts to be annoying...
compiz has window size hooks in 'place windows' if you use that, or else use an app called devilspie
where do i find this size hook?
in compizconfig-settings-manager it's in 'place windows' (window management section), you will need to enter a hook like the windows class name or something to identify it, than you can enter x and y coordinates for size
thanks
if you see the 'place windows' settings, second tab called fixed window size .. do you have compizconfig-settings-manager ? some use simple-ccsm and i'm not sure that provides that hook ..
okay thanks
Whats the use of regular expressions ?

yeah you are supposed to see that menu upon choosing recovery mode in grub, but you said you aren't getting anywhere. Do you have more than one kernel installed to just try recovery mode on a different version?
vexille: no one kernak
try this guide for using a livecd to reset your password http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/linux/reset-your-ubuntu-password-easily-from-the-live-cd/.  The steps should be similar to what you were using as a guide before, but this just uses the livecd to mount your hard drive and chroot to it so yo ucan perform the same steps as in the guide you posted

Help, I am having trouble making a backup of my system to my external hard drive, I did rsync -avh --delete --stats /home/sebastian/ /media/SAMSUNG/mybackup and i got a whole bunch of outputs with these errors rsync: chgrp "/media/SAMSUNG/mybackup/.icons/Mac4Lin_Icons_v0.4/scalable/mimetypes/application-x-rar.png" failed: Operation not permitted (1). far as i know the hard drive is mounted
probably you do not have the permissions to writte in the backupdisk
how do i get hte permissions? i used sudo. it worked the first couple of times i backed up
what filesystem is used on the backup disk ?
how do i check that?.  msdos
grep -i samsung /proc/mounts.  well you can not store unix permissions/ownership on a vfat filesystem
/dev/sdd1 /media/SAMSUNG vfat rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,uid=1000,fmask=0077,dmask=0077,codepage=cp437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,utf8 0 0
and I got this error "FATAL: Error running install command for fglrx".  and I got this error "FATAL: Error running install command for fglrx"
did you try a reboot?
when I tried "glxinfo | grep direct" everything went black and I was back at the login screen, is that a full boot?
I used my flashdrive as a instaler for some distros...now I want to use it again as a simple storage device, but I'm trying to format it and it seems to always keep the boot partition inside it, how to set it back to its default state ?
'keep the boot partition' ? how-so?
I don't know, but when I try to create a new partition it mounts the device with the name "ubuntu...."
ah ok, 'dd' 100MB to the start of the drive after deleting the partition on it and it'll be nuked
what is the command ?
I just did a:. $ sudo cp * /windows/*. does this mean I've ovewritten my /windows dir?. :/
it just overwrote files with same name
but I was in directory /vmware.  so it was like: $ sudo cp /vmware/* /windows/*.  have I lost them?
depends on what was in vmware, any file that had the same name as a file in windows would get overwritten I believe
I just had one file in that directory
so if you had a, b, c in vmware and c, d in window, your windows would then have a, b, c, d with c coming from vmware
I had one file called VMware-server-installer-e.x.p-23870.exe. in /vmware
then your /windows should be fine
there's no VMware-server-installer-e.x.p-23870.exe. in /windows.  great :).  that gave me a scare, thanks.  what's this all about though.... cp: omitting directory `/windows/Documents and Settings'. cp: omitting directory `/windows/found.000'
i gotta question. how do i update xchat?
there is no newer version then 2.0.8 for warty

I get that every time I start firefox.. I'm looking forward to a clean install of karmic

hey , someone can help me to install the new version of notification "looks" of Ubuntu 9.04 into 8.10? Which name of this package?. how I do to install new style notification how in Ubuntu Jaunty 9.04?. My dist is 8.10
you don't mix and match versions.  9.04 packages are for 9.04 - not 8.10
all right, but I need to install that version, how I could to do?
why do you "need" that version.  that version is a development and not stable and meant for general use yet
not need to be the 9.04 version, I could to compile it!
is anyone else experiencing random freezes on 9.04 ?
ext4?
I don't bellieve so, I upgraded from 8.10

is there an api reference for making panel applets for unity?
indicators?.  or dock icons?
is that what they are called? the ones next to the wifi, bluetooth and sound icons.
indicators.  I'm right now working on unified keyboard indicator and I can recommend you to study code of message indicator (one used by gwibber, empathy and tbird).  it's pretty understandable
thanks! :).  I tried writing a panel applet the other day (I have one that controls my music laptop over ssh) and It just lacked a good api
i think it's all pretty uncommited type of interfaces and apis ... it may change anytime.  gnome and related projects really doesn't care about documentation a lot ....  (my point of view)
fair enough, it doesn't bother me... but is there at at least an indicator that someone has written that uses a lot of the features? would be handy to look at that source...
but 3.3 -> 3.4 breaks the ABI anyway. jesus_: umask=002 in the options field
Only on archs that are not in Ubuntu I think, . But still it did
I thought it broke the C++ ABI everywhere?
let me throw this out there .. if i want to compile something from source do i have to do a apt-get build-dep <package name> or is there another command ?
what do you want to build ?
- i installed ffmpeg from apt-get install but i built it last time so i want t build it again
why do you want to build it ? building things when you don't know what you are doing can have serious implications to your systems stability ?.  is there a problem with the package from the repo ?
- no. - i need experience

what?. hodgman you are being funny right?
No, I'm not. It's quite nice, I was thinking about rolling up a package for it
anyone tried to sid->hoary ?
sid->hoary doesn't work too well. You're better off running sid _with_ hoary or vice versa, but one of them needs to be pinned.
I checked wiki and it says only gnome is problematic. which I don't care :/
I presume you only have hoary lines now?.  it's doable if not a bit crufty
yup.  well I will report any success :-)
I run sid+experimental+hoary myself pinned to sid to make things easier
well unless it has extreme borkage I will stick with hoary only

how to edit kernel modules assgined to an ethernet controller?
edit in what way?
edit in a mode that it is changed
rephrase what you mean....
If I type : lspci -v I will see that my ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8169 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10) is displayed it has kernel modules: r8169 assigned to it. I want to change it so that r8168 is assigned to it and not r8169
hardware failures can be really flakey...  blacklist the one you dont want to use. and load the other module
because I have already blacklisted r8169 and it is still showing
rmmod it...
I already did that

The port isnt forwarded
I've put one in my router, but it still has the same problem.
Is it forwarded properly?
maybe not. Got some tips?
lol, other than read the manual, not really. Every router is different... Make sure you are forwarding it, and not triggering it, and make sure you are forwarding the right port to the right server.
ok, Thanks. Is there anything in the server I could check? i've set it up on a non-standard port...
anyway i can install ET x86 on 64bit ?
yes, I think so

back to business.  is that miniupnp thing with authentication?
??? no clue. I only found out it existed about 5 mins ago. Installed it and it is running some kind of configuration. Apparently it will fix my router config so that I can use nicotine.
but do you know what upnp is?. it usually allows unauthenticated clients on your local network to establish a port forward to itself. imo, it's not something you want :)
ok... so do you have any idea why nicotine still says my ports are closed?
probably because it doesnt use upnp?. just forward the port manually. www.portforward.com

a regular user do not need to be added to "admin" group to have a limited sudo access for command like shutdown ? or all sudo'ers need to be added to admin group for allowing any system commands?
with the default setup, you need to be in "admin" for using sudo. always.
i added a user, with shutdown priviledge only, but I have not added the user to admin group, so it would not work?
how did you give them shutdown privilege?
via visudo.  like usernam ALL=(root)/sbin/shutdown -r now
that should work without the user being in admin
but it is getting an error, user usernam is not allowed to execute /sbin/shutdown -r now as root
anyone knows anything about the System map error?
a System.map is generally built along with the kernel. have you recently built a new kernel on your machine?
yes 
then you can find a System.map in the build directory. place it in /boot, preferably renamed to match the current kernel version.
errrm build directory?
where you put the source for the kernel you built :-)
the CD?
did you not build this kernel from source?
yes, from the liveCD. I didn't do it manually
you don't mean "installed from a package" right?.  "build from source" means "compile the source code and install" :-)
ohhh. sorry for my misleading info then. still a newbie, which I believe you already figured out :D
how do you set up subversion server?
For what kind of access?
i just would like to have multiple people working on a website i have and thought it might be good to have svn (or simmilar)
Sure, but, via ssh? HTTP?
either i guess. but http is preferable
ssh is the easy one.
ok
If you have svn installed and they have ssh access, svn+ssh:// will Just Work.
so would you be able to do the ssh way from a windows client?
Yes..  I know that TortoiseSVN supports it, at the very least.
oh well i was gonna use tortoise anyway.  so what do you need to do to set it up?.  ive only ever used it from a clients perspective
First you need to create a repository..  "svnadmin help create" for more info on that..  Are you familiar with putty and pageant at all?
not really.  ive used putty for basic ssh connections
Hi, anyone having problems with amarok?. When I start amarok now, it just quits after opening the main window
ribs, i am
Same problem as me?
the ubuntu version is old
it was working for ages, then suddenly did this. even deleteing .kde/share/apps/amarok didn't fix it
yes, mine occasionaly hangs on the start, usually it works it self out after a reboot or the removal of the ~/.kde/share/apps/amarok directory. lol ribs. you thought of the same thing i did
:).  people who use amarok a lot often have to do that, I think :)
hello. i got a problem when i do apt-get dist-upgrade. i receive thousand of update

and so the is impossible to update the system
how can i get a wireless network device (wlan0) to send a dhclient request by default?
in System->Administration->Networking
manual way? not running gnome.  i got this in my /etc/network/interface: iface wlan0 inet dhcp
and it doesn't do it? if you do ifdown wlan0&&ifup wlan0 ?
yes, that works. :) the problem is it doesn't do that on boot.
is it a pcmcia card?
yes
have you done anything unusual in init.d?
havn't modified it at all. hotplug devices are pulled up, wlan0 find's most suitable AP, just doesn't send dhcp request.
in the boot sequence, you get "starting card services" before "configuring network interfaces"?
that i'd have to check..what's the cmd? dmesg?
can ubuntu run faster by creating a swap file on a fast flash drive instead of making the typical swap on a hard drive?
generally flash will be slower than hdd
i mean for caching small things
if you're talking usb3 with old IDE drive...
hmm so my ole 7200 rpm sata beats a sandisk cruzer flash drive for memory caching?
does anyone know if it's possible to get into a terminal during an ubuntu install?

Oh, so you are not accustomed to Unity. (Is that it?)
LOL I'm not accustomed to linux. But I've had it with windows
I installed SSH and set up port forwarding and such. I can connect but when I connect over the internet it won't let the user login
define "won't let"
It says access denied, though when I connect over the local network it does it just fine.
are you trying to use root which you've horribly created a password for?
Nope
i have a ibm thinkpad t20 with a Xircom Mini-PCI V.90 56k Modem, how can i make it work with 7.10?
You want to get it going for dialup?
yes, now i am using ethernet, but the owner live in a place without adsl
Find the modem by going to a terminal and typing dmesg | grep ttyS It should show up as ttyS5 Test in terminal sudo screen /dev/ttyS5.  Your ttys x will be differsnt.  I happen to have a similar xircom here... 10-100-56k
dmesg tells me 00:0c: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A that should be the serial port
Test in terminal sudo screen /dev/ttyS0 but I dont hink it will be.. that looks like std external serial port
i obtain a blank screen....
type atz.  followed by enter of course
i tried to type atz in screen, but i see nothing, btw i dont know screen
Then that isnt the right port Use ctrl-A then K to kill the modem terminal.  from terminal type lspci and look for the modem
00:03.1 Serial controller: Xircom Mini-PCI V.90 56k Modem.  should i try to install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.22-14-386?
Hi. I'm having trouble finding links to updated tutorials on installing RoundCube. The ones I'm finding talk about localhost/webmail/installer but I don't have an 'installer' directory anywhere.
I'd guess that when you unzip/install the PHP, you would to that to either the /var/www or a virtual host directory. It looks like installer should be in there
Does it matter that I installed RoundCube from my package manager? (apt-get)
I didn't know it was in there. I remember when I installed phpmyadmin from packages it went somewhere most unexpected.
I can access the login interface but when I log in it says 500 internal error and anything I click brings me back to the login screen and says session expired/invalid
you done this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Roundcube.  which suggest /usr/share/roundcube as the main install dir
I've found that directory, I already created the sym link.
it's possible that installation is complete as part of the config process. So maybe there is no need for a /installer directory ?
I'm going through dpkg-reconfigure roundcube-core right now. This seems to be what I was looking for.
and the roundcore-mysql is installed too?
Not sure, let me check.. Unable to locate package
where are most program files?
in /usr/bin
so if i wanted to install a program i would make a folder in there and then put the files there?

Hello, I want to delete a user that I don't recognize. Under "User Settings", I see the user that I want to delete, but the delete button is not highlighted, and the unlock button is not highlighted either. How can I delete a user then?
if you don't have admin privileges you can not unlock the users
<unconvertable>  It's my machine. <unconvertable>  I have root password
try pressing the greyed out unlock button
<unconvertable>  Nothing. <unconvertable>  I fear I've been hacked... but there must be a way to remove the user if I have root pass
update or install from alternate cd. i use beep media player in powerpc gutsy and no orpblem
sir i apologize but technically i am new in ubuntu. how do i update through the alternate cd? i have just downloaded a live cd of gutsy but my first install was from an upgrade from feisty? thanks
if you put the alternate install cd in, ubuntu its self should recognise it as a package cd and offer to upgrade from it.
I am getting this error while trying to create partition: Error creating partition on /dev/sdb: Command-line `parted --align optimal --script "/dev/sdb" "mkpart logical ext2 4796MiB 5528800255b"' exited with non-zero exit status 1: Error: You requested a partition from 5029MB to 5529MB.. The closest location we can manage is 5029MB to 5529MB.. (udisks-error-quark, 0). http://paste.ubuntu.com/13005683/
Please pastebin the output of "sudo smartctl --all /dev/sdb".
it says "smartctl: command not found" a typing error maybe?
Does anyone know of any data recovery programs that work on lost linux partitions?
foremost recovers lost files
ya that's all i need to do really. Thanks let me see if I can get that to work.
its not "complicated" to me, i use it a lot. but you have to use quite a few steps.
ya the main problem for me is that the partition is lost (literally). It just dissapeared. So i can't type things like dd_rescue /dev/sda6 /dev/sda2 because i don't have a distinct partition to scan
What Java package does LibreOffice need?
ubuntu-trestricted-extras installed <unconvertable> should install openjdk
ubuntu-restricted-extras is not installed on my computer. openjdk-6-jre, openjdk-6-jre-headless and openjdk-6-jre-lib are installed though.
How do you mount a USB internet conection?. Or even a WIFI connection?

Hmm, I'm having a fairly frustrating problem with my webserver. I'm using PHP, and firefox wants to save all PHP files instead of opening them.
Has apache got the php server extension installed?
I've been told that parsed PHP files should be MIME type text/html, but it's application/x-httpd-php.  yeah. libapache2-mod-php
I'm going to use the LiveCD to boot into Ubuntu 10.10, do I actually need the 10.10 CD, or will a new 11.04 work as well?
I don't understand the question. Do you mean you have 10.10 installed on a hard drive and you want to use the 11.04 live CD as the boot loader?.  then, yes it will work
thank you. :)
Is there special instructions for compiling alsa on ubuntu?
why compile - you have packages
so my microphone, mic port, and headphone port will work
hey. anyoone can help me to edit dependency of *.deb file
You can't just do that, you'd have to rebuild the package from source.
can't i just edit the control file of it

what would cause slow (over 10 minutes) restoration from hibernating?
either very slow (or bad) ram, or more commonly, an Nvidia gfx card with nvidia drivers version 180
oddly enough, the image restores much faster (percentage goes up faster) if I just hold enter
Hi. Any free file upload service to share debug log files ?
yes such services are known as pastebin and such
i am looking out for uploading
in that cause any file upload would suite right?
yes.  do you have information offhand
I get whitescreen after I ctrl+alt+backspace and login again..why? :(
alt-ctrl-f2 login and do 'sudo adduser' then alt-f7 to get back to gui and see if that user has same problem
yep same problem
id alt-ctrl-f2 and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg since it seems to be an x thing not a user config. before that are you using beryl or anything?
yes im using builtin feisty.  compiz*
ah. hmm i had a similar problem that was solved by upgrading version of beryl but that might be a pain on ubuntu. umm are you using nvidia or ati. you might upgrade graphics driver that'd be first thing id try
hrm im using intel drivers..
i915 setup?
yep
Where are storage drives usually mounted? Somewhere in /mnt, or /media?
automounted ones tend to live in /media
Assuming they're permanent.  yeah, I mean more for storage partitions
You may not be able to get anything more than the chipset, but lsusb would be your best bet
That error is because there is no kubuntu 12.04 (check the URL's parents using a browser). What process caused that error? Is it release-upgrade?.  The Kubunut releases were moved from releases.ubuntu.com to cdimage.ubuntu.com : http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/12.04/release/
installing Kubuntu through Wubi on Windows. http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?distro=wubi&release=&bits=. If they've moved to a new domain, don't you think it's rather silly to not at least put up some 304 redirectors?
It must be something to do with the installer's expectation of where to find the ISOs
Makes sense. I was just noting it in here in hopes that someone who can maintain it, or cares enough to post it on a bugtracker, could see it.
Thanks. I'm chasing down the source code now
No problem.
bug #496957.  IT would be helpful if could +1 that bug using the "Does this bug affect you?" link at top-left
Wow, that's almost 3 years old and still there.. Seems like that's both easy to fix and rather critical to fix

Can someone help me with my wlan printer. I can ping it, can see it in router, can open printer webserver, can add printer to available printer, but when I try to print it says "unable to locate". Any idea why?
so. I'm super unfamiliar w/ printers and their various WTFisms, but one thing I *have* learned is that if random printer X is failing in some inexplicable fashion, whether one is on Windows, OSX or Linux.  try switching printer drivers and/or protocols.  in this case I'd suggest protocol first.  jetdirect/ipp/unix.  ipp is usually the most reliable, but not always. office printer for some insane reason only handled unix. even under windows had to go through some ridiculous hoops of specifying the "wrong" driver and alternate connection method
I'm sorry, how to go about switching protocols?
when you add the printer, there should be a specify option. lemme fire up the add printer wizard here in MATE.  so... under the [+] Add Printer option, there is a Network Printer dropdown - at least in the wizard I'm using
The wizard finds the printer, and I can choose that, then it will use ipp via dns-sd is what it says
ok.  try another protocol then <unconvertable>.  you don't see a list of protocols in the initial thing? guess you're using a different wizard :/
I see the list
ok. so try, oh, jetdirect plus the IP of the printer
for example if I choose ipps it asks me for a device uri
I'd try jetdirect first since you said IPP was failing
I don't have jetdirect in my list
huh...
Oh my bad, there it is. AppSocket/HP JetDirect
also on my wizard it gives examples of IPP URIs when you select IPP*
jetdirect also asks for a port number. I don't see the port number in the printer webserver. Should I just go with the default 9100?
hmm, question about setting up eggdrop..i used synaptic to install it...for the config file. any ideas where that'd be?
most likely in /etc/eggdrop
merci
i think
let's find out :). neg, not there
I am trying to run: sudo mkdir mnt/sdd but I am getting the message mkdir: cannot create directory `mnt/sdd': Read-only file system. can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong
Are you on a live CD?
no it is a full install of server 10.10 with Desktop GUI installed on top. but I am running this command through SSH
Well, it complains that the fs you are on is read-only. I note that you said mkdir mnt/sdd and not mkdir /mnt/sdd so is your current working dir on some read-only meadia?
Can you offer any advice?. just saw your response :-)
What does pwd say?
it just tells me my current dir
Which is?
/home/user
Any idea why that is suddenly read-only?
if I try sudo mkdir /mnt/sdd then I get the same result. nope not sure. maybe I need to be root?
Well, you *did* put sudo in front and also, the complaint was that it was read-only. Perhaps you have had some sort of fs failure that prompted the partition to be remounted read-only?
I am not sure. I do know that my developer is doing some work with Puppet on this server and there are a bunch of items in the /mnt dir that I think are related to a Puppet run. any thoughts on why that might cause the /mnt dir to be read-only? Does Puppet do that while it is running?
i am doing a very delicate rsync. and i just want to be sure i have the options right
have you ever checked out rdiff-backup?
well i want to copy one hard drive onto another. and the destination hard drive is empty. i am doing rsync -ax /mnt/hdb/ /mnt/hda/
just once?
just once. yes. where /mnt/hdb is the source and /mnt/hda is the destination
How exactly does one set up Samba to interact between two hard drives in the same box?
?? why would you do that?
Pestilence: To move files from one hard drive to the other.
anyone know if a text based browser that handles java pages?
java or javascript?

do most plugins on firefox work the same on linux as in windows? like you don't have to do anything special to install or get them to work?
well, usually, but right now, the flash installer is broken, so it requires a little more work(but its ot hard)
loudnloma helped me get the flash working just about an hour ago, there's no problem there :]. i'm talking about greasemonkey specifically
hey I keep most of my media on a seperate partition, so i have a folder on the desktop called music pointing to the music file, but the link breaks on reboot. If i open the points it mounted on then they work, do i need to add extra mount options?
<unconvertable>  same question here. i guess there's a way to automount the drive but i don't know how.
the drive is auto mounting... but the links dont work until it is opened once
if the package is local, then one should use dpkg,, not apt. sudo dpkg -i <whatever.deb
that doesnt work i tried that too. both -i --ii -install --install
for dpkg, or apt?
both
OK. so you downloaded a package, then tried dpkg -i /give/the/full/path/whatever.deb. What, exactly, happened?
the package never downloaded it says file or no directory found. apt, dpkg, i tried lynx browser
(1) dpkg will only work if the package is already downloaded; (2) apt will fetch the package from the reositories
it is not in the repositories or cache, whatever you call it. so i tried https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-media-server/1.9.4.4325-1bf240a65/plexmediaserver_1.9.4.4325-1bf240a65_amd64.deb but it doesnt work
you tried *what* on this URL?. cuz neither dpkg nor apt will work on it
apt -install, apt -i, apt --i, apt --install with URL after
will not work. apt will download a package from the repositories, NOT from anywhere else.  so, since the URL is elsewhere, YOU must download it manually, and then use dpkg
strive told me wget is download URL. Why is this not told in my tutorial? so if app is not in cache you cnat download. ridiculous.
I cannot answer why your tutorial gives you the wrong information, sorry..  as I said before: (1) dpkg will only work if the package is already downloaded; (2) apt will fetch the package from the reositories
yes strive is guiding me through it thank you . the tutorial was recommended to me by a linux power user. seems to me this wget command is ESSENTIAL.
since you are trying to install an unknown package from somewhere else, yes, you have to download it somehow
Ok here is the question that popped my mind; in the menu.lst, hd(#,#) can it be sd(#,#)? or its not possible only written as hd?
GRUB uses its own nameing scheme. its hd(#,#)
ok
i'm seeking an old PCI video card to run 9.10 on. what should i look for or avoid, compatibility-wise? is Voodoo good/bad?
try for a nvidia 7series or higher
as in 7xxx?. 7600, 7900, etc.
yes, i have an 3yr old 7600gt, and its fine on the all the distros since 8.04
are you recommending this because you know it works, or because i need that for performance?
This is the build log of module assistant failing to install fglrx Build log starting, file: /var/cache/modass/fglrx-kernel-source.buildlog.2.6.27-3-rt.1229459240. Date: Tue, 16 Dec 2008 20:27:20 +0000. no useful info. can anyone suggest a step I can take to troubleshoot my problem please?
that's a real-time kernel?
yes.  yes it is. rt on hardy worked with fglrx.
hmmm, i don't know much about real-time kernels. i don't know.  what version of the fglrx driver?
what would you do on a normal kernel?.  I dont know. I have tried to install whatever is in the Ibex repo.
i don't think there is an fglrx driver in the Ibex repo... unless they recently added it, because ati only recently cam out with an fgrlx driver that works with kernel 2.6.27. s/cam/came
not this then? http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/xorg-driver-fglrx
i would download the this file... ati-driver-installer-8-12-x86.x86_64.run, make it executable, and then run it while i'm in x-windows, then reboot... that's how i would install it.  ok. going to look at link now..  looks like an older version of the fglrx driver than the recent fglrx 8.12 release. my version is... 8.56.4
I will try that download you suggest. Thanks. BAck in a bit...

can mount any drives on ubuntu 10.04
could you explain a bit more ?
my drives are not showing on disk utility or in places bt i can see them on gparted.  its an ntfs file system
try 'sudo mount -a '.  so long as your drives aren't corrupt, you will be able to access them on ubuntu..  any progress ?
i did.its says can't find sdb2 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
do you have more than one HDD ?
i have 2
k, how many partitions ?
only one on that hard drive

hi everyone, my "file" command only ever gives the error message "file: could not find any valid magic files!". man pages says magic.mgc file is in anaconda folder: anaconda3/share/misc/magic.mgc. anyone have any suggestions?
What does `file /bin/sh` say?
hi chai, thanks for the response. it gives the same error message. it always just says "file: could not find any valid magic files!" no matter what file I apply it on
What does `which file` say?
anaconda3/bin/file, it uses the anaconda distro. well ~/anaconda3/bin/file
You might get better help in #python or something like that..  Assuming that Anaconda is the Python distribution.
aye it is. it seems weird to me that a core linux command like file would use a version that comes with anaconda, but I suppose it has to do with the python magic libs I use. anyway, thanks for the advice, I will try
The user's home directory can contain a bin directory. If it does, the files in it are used before the system files..  If you want to prevent that, move the distribution to some subdirectory of the user's home directory instead. Then, its bin directory won't be ~/bin..
ah right. but it's not ~/bin though, it's ~/anaconda3/bin
I just installed Ubuntu 15.04 and coming from a Mac as my desktop, I can open spotlight and search for an installed app. When I open the unity search bar by just tapping the Super key, I can type 'calc' and calculator is never an option. But if I hit ubuntu button and type that, it shows a bunch of application results. What am I missing?
that works for me, but its not very reliable. I useually try to avoid the dash because its super slow
is there a better alternative that behaves like Spotlight or Alfred from mac?
gnome terminal is still using bash even though I ran chsh /usr/bin/zsh do I need to relogin for this to change?
try 'xterm -ls' it may only change for your login shell.
that also used bash
yea.. noticing that also. :P.  not sure what the deal is. heh.. make a new profile that runs the shell ya want. I perfer the 'fish' shell myself.. chsh changes the user login shell. This determines the name of the users initial login command..  try it at the console.. it used the new shell there for me. :P
I figured it out. I'm running zsh as a custom command rather than my shell
heh.
under Edit -> Current Profile in the tab Title and Command I checked "Run a custom command instead of my shell" and typed in zsh for the "Custom command"
I need help setting up VNCServer with a changed port. I have completely screwed up my vnc install. I have files from some guides that probably may be interfering with correct setups. I need someone to hold my hand and help me fix this.
i belive you could always give the port/options on teh command line and they will override any config file ssttings.
i'm trying to setup vnc to load on boot before login, it's a vmware server guest..  but I've fouled it up big time
Is there a tool I can use to monitor total monthly bandwidth?
You can use iftop I guess.  or vnStat
vnStat looks more like it  - cheers!
When update-grub is run, my /boot/grub/menu.lst looks fine. But when I boot, it's different. My /boot is a separate partition. Any ideas?
you probably have a /boot on each partition and you're seeing one, then the other?
Feels like that, but I don't understand how I can examine the situation. Can I list /boot in my root partition without unmounting /boot?
what do you mean 'list'?
I'd like to know if I have another menu.lst in my root-partition before /boot is mounted
i guess you could boot to a live cd, then look at your partitions that way.  is that wahat you meant?
Sounds fair, yes. Just thought there would be another way. It's an lvm partition so it'd take a while..  I'm going to experiment some with grub, feels like it's booting from wrong partition in some way. Not good.
install sysinfo.  whats LVM?>
logical volume, useful if you eg want to group a bunch of disks into one partition.
hi i get "I/O error on device sr0" at the end of installation ? What should i do?

what is the latest flash?
type about:plugins into firefox's address bar and see what version you've got
9.0 r124.  how come i can view all videos except the ones on facebook?.  i can view the ones on facebook like 4 days ago. how to install flash 10 properly?
sudo apt-get --reinstall install flashplugin-installer
do i need to uninstall 9 first?
how did you install 9? outside the repos?
long time ago. and i installed version 10. but somehow couple days ago version is back. i dont know why. do i do this 1st: sudo apt-get remove flashplugin-nonfree. then close ff and this? sudo dpkg -i sudo dpkg -i install_flash_player_10_linux.deb
check .mozilla/plugins folder, and remove and flash releted .so files first.
dont have .mozilla/plugins
Hey. How can I upgrade FluxBox?
Download the package with synaptic.  Then select it from the sessions list on the logon screen
I already have FluxBox.  0.9.14
In that case, just start the package manager and hit update
Wanted to know how can I upgrade since I get this 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded..  I did that's what I got 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Are you sure you don't have the latest version?
I'm sure..  that's what it tells me atleast when I do fluxbox -i

I'm having a really strange problem. I can't ls my /media directory, it hangs. I can cd to any directory and there and ls those, but not /media Any ideas?
Do you have any NFS mounts in /media?
no, but I had sshfs. It seemed to stop after that
Is sshfs a remote file syste?
yes, it mounts a connection to a directory on an ssh server
Has that server been shut down? I have had a similar problem with nfs and it was due to a server being down.
no, I had unmounted it while the machine was still on.

can someone please help me with installing java?
sure, what problems are you having?
i just can't install it...something about no such file/directory
huh?
i tried using the synaptics package manager, i installed the java package there, and it didn't work. so i tried using sudo, and following java's instructions. didn't work
let's try installing it from the command line.  using apt
apt?
advanced packaging tool.  it's what synaptic uses in the background.  so, open up a terminal
ok
then type in sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
hm..something's working. but how would i know that if i never used this forum and asked people lol. what if i tried to follow java's instructions?
beats me :P
they told me to use su, and i actually tried it, but still didn't work =T

off topic.
do you know where can I find the answer?
how do you tell Xorg how much video memory your device has (ATI Radeon 9800 pro using the fglrx drivers)?
there's VideoRam option under the card definition, see man radeon
I have Driver "fglrx" right now, is there a reason I should use radeon instead?
no, I don't have an ati, man fglrx will have the info as well, I assume
hmm it doesn't.... it says "radeon" only supports 2D for my card...
that was only an example
man gflrx doesn't exist...
lol, I guess it's not ubuntan, is it :)
ubuntan?
VideoRam is a standard option for all cards
ok... I'll try that..
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (100) <----------i get this when i sudo apt-get install -f anyone know why
not without seeing the full output
there is nothing of interest before that error
are you sure? I find that unlikely
unless you consider typical dpkg output to be of interest
right - well this is what typical dpkg output for that command looks like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/56187/
i just want my apt-get fixed
then help us to help you - are you saying that your output looks identical to mine except for that error?
no
then please paste it, if it is innocuous then that rules one option out
http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/56188/
it looks like you're trying to install dpkg itself?
no. im trying to run sudo apt-get install -f
yes, it feels that it needs dpkg to correct some error; what were you doing before this happened?
forcing a downgrade someone swore to me would fix kopete
aha, so you overrode apt with the force commands?.  what exactly did you force?
some patch for kopete

alright i tried hitting esc as the system booted and i got a menue that has the options run from usb install on machine check memory and boot from first harddisk, i also have boot options the boot options under install from usb already have something written in them. can i erase what is uder run from usb and type whatever it takes to run in compatibility mode
if you can remove quiet and splash from the boot options u will get some error reporting
i saw splash in there but not quiet. i remembered that when i was running that system on linux mint live usb i had to boot in compatibility if tha helps
so why u messin around with ubuntu? ;)

which should i choose for the firewall to monitor! the ppp0 or the eth1 ?
eth1 is likely to be an ethernet RJ45 connection
nessieliberation, well my cable is plugged into the ethernet card.. though wht im askign is which one should i choose for the firewall to monitor!. nessieliberation , should it b the ppp0 or eth1 !
load a system monitor, and see which one moves. chances are it might be both
nessieliberation , yup its loadded allready and ur right! both of them are moving
then a guess would suggest that both would be the safest option. although just ppp0 might work
nessieliberation i ran the wizard and it only lets me choose one!

your system is not in an aceptable state.  as I told you earlier.  1.) you should not be logged in as root 2.) you should have a non-privileged user 3.) you have no need to use sudo as root
not acceptable? that's the logical explanation why my user who is in sudoers doesn't work?. I am logged in as a personal user that is in sudoers file
A wine-game has changed the resolution of one of my dualview monitors. Is there a way to get it back to normal without the hastle of an x-restart?
<ctrl>-<alt>-<+>
Not working :(
well anyways, hi - I tried Ubuntu (first time trying linux) .. sometime ago. I failed. But I learned my lesson -- forcing things like GNOME on a 6 year old laptop - so I'm back, hopefully everything will work out this time. I've a problem though - a lot seems to be gone.. I'm now on shell, and for example, if I "apt" - I get back "bash: apt : command not found". Now being that I can't do much . . . what would be a good place for me to start
sudo apt-get
"bash: sudo: command not found"
you need to enable your sudo account - look it up on the Ubuntu starter guide
Do be aware, that I am on root (getting something like root@(none):~ $". #* =s
Evening all.. How would my friend check if CPU scaling is working on his laptop?
cat /proc/cpuinfo
Will that tell him what it's doing right now, or just what it could do?
That will just give the clock speed
The clock speed now, or the "Normal" one?
hey can someone help me out with some wifi stuff ?. I am trying to get ipw2100 working with a PRO/Wireless 2200BG card

I need to install the driver.  - you still there ?
-> yeah, go and load your driver first
- I think I have the drivers installed
hey...there's something wrong with my nvidia driver or card.....it was working fine till now when my screen just suddenly started showing weird colors and pixels...whats wrong??
: check your cable connection
what has the cable got to do with my display?

hi guys, were can i get info about ubuntu backports??????. i need backports for feisty
what sort of info ?.  enable the backports repo and try to update
how i enable the repo? what address has it?
open system --> admin --> software sources manager and just enable the backports repo in that
i'm remotelly connected to a server :).  maybe just feisty-backports ?
then edit /etc/apt/sources.list by hand
aha.  and?
andwhat ?
what i have to add? deb http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ feisty-backports or something?
I know I'm not supposed to repeat my question every few minutes if nobody responds, what's the optimal alternative? I don't mind being patient, just don't want to wait 1/2 hour if nobody saw my question. Thanks.
what is your problem
I was messing with update-motd, and it stopped working. I cleared motd, and later rebooted the server, but the motd won't come back. no error messages that I'm aware of.
np =).  motd for ssh or local session?
ssh.  haven't tried local yet, should I?
if local is what you need... but your problem doesn't seen to complicate.  just checking onething... just a sec
it's /etc/motd that I'm concerned with. I can populate it manually, but update-motd doesn't seem to work. can't find any verbose to see where it's having a problem though..  np, take your time. I've been pulling my hair out for an hour before I gave up and came here :)
how do I show the IP-numer instead of URL in Firefox?
there is a /dns command available in more irc clients, you can use that '/dns www.google.com'
no in firefox
when replying to someone, its best to use their nick in your response, so they can see your reply
sure
what do you want to do ?
see IP number instead of URL so I can traceroute website. in firefox
it'll be one application i'll run with, preferably, BASH. i'm hoping I can fit all this on say... an 8 MB flash card
well lfs would be good b/c you can make it to do exactly that program if it is to be embedded
ahhhh, I see
so it is not embedded?
well, it will be embedded
then lfs would make it simple and easy
cool ;). how much space you think I can fit it in?
kinda drawn out but it will be *perfect* for _you_.  depends on drivers and such daemons
no daemons, remember?. no video drivers. a sound driver. no USB drivers. and no PS/2 drivers
the custom kernel is almost very small
all i'll need are sound drivers
Why is it that when I ask for a dhcp address 127.0.1.1 responds? Is there a way to make it recieve it from the server every time?
can you explain your problem once more?
I'm trying to figure out why dhcp addresses are not going to certain switches. When i run dhclient, I'm getting the dhcpack from 127.0.1.1 (I'm not running a server), and I assume it's getting it from a local cache (already wiped /var/lib/dhcp3/).
you run dhclient and get an address? I don't understand what this has to do 'with certain' switches
Heh, sorry i'm explaining it poorly. I'm trying to figure out if a port from each switch can get an ip address from the dhcp server. But my dhcpacks are coming from 127.0.1.1, so I can't tell which one is working
switches usually don't mess with dhcp, you are not trying to give an IP-address to the switch, are you?
no. I have pxe clients, and if i plug the dhcp server into one switch, only certain clients can get the pxe image, and different ones if I plug it into another. Something either isn't forwarding broadcast or is dropping packets
Anyone here use SARA? My make always fails here -> http://paste.ubuntu.com/32159/
that looks scary... why does it want to run nmap ? (the port scanner???)
because its a vulnerability testing program
Hi, I'm looking for a GTK-based GTD (Get Things Done) app for Linux. I used to use Things on Mac, but having transferred from Mac to Ubuntu I'm not sure what to use.
there is a good app... i just dont remember the name....
I looked around and found things like fluidity, but that's unreleased at the moment and whatnot... I also heard of NextAction, and the like...
I'm having a problem with sound. When ever I listen to any music (on any media player) or watch any video (even youtube) the sound starts to skip and jump around. What would cause this, and how could I fix it?
do you know which driver you are using, alsa, oss?
Alsa
under preferences->sound do you have multiple choices for each dropdown?
"HDA Nvidia (analog)" "HDA Nvidia (digital)" "Pluseaudio"
i'd try each one, and play sound, and see if it improves. for the sound playback option
They all skip.
I have a problem getting my apache server working on the internet. I can access it on localhost and through lan, but not outside.
Did you forward everything that comes in on port 80 to your webserver ?
- yes, i do. Through my router
Try connecting your computer directly to the internet.  If you are able to connect via LAN, it seems like a router mis-configuration
- can't. i have a combined router/modem.  - well, i did exactly as when i configured my ssh, and that worked
Okay. What do a "traceroute <host>" show ? (pastebin, please).  From outside your network
- i don't have any machines outside my network.
Ah, that's why! :).  You have to enable a special feature in your router if you are trying to access your server from within your network on a public IP / domain.  What's your domian/IP ?
- www.moppa.se
Hm, no. That dosn't work.  What's the IP ?
- or hackback.servebeer.com
Maybe you misconfigured DNS
- 213.64.134.153
Okay, looks right - weird..
- you are not getting any webpage served, right?
But again, the webserver is accessible through LAN ?.  Nope, no web page is being displayed
- yes
And 213.64.134.153 is YOUR ip, right ? Not some redirector, dyndns or what ever
- Nope, that's the ip to my router.
Okay, seems that port 80 is not open
- check now?
where can I find support for open suse>>
#opensuse #freenode google, opensuse.com
What irc server?
this
Thanks! :)
Hi, just noticed that I have tmpfs twice in breezy when I do df -h?

after installing Ubuntu Mate 17.10 it only loaded to a grub shell with grub>. I managed to get it to boot. now I can't ssh into the machine; how to start ssh?
is it uefi?.  so the booting issue is solved?
it does have sda1 as UEFI system partition, but I had to set root (hd0,2) and found files in there.  so it's not solved, but I could do that again.  if I could start ssh it would help ;).  from ps aux it seems to have systemd as init, and I've never used systemd. so a bit lax at how to start ssh
install the ssh server "sudo apt-get install openssh-server"
http://termbin.com/xn4i. ok
"sudo systemctl enable ssh" to enable and "sudo systemctl restart ssh" to restart it
I'm already root # so I assume I can leave off sudo now. I sudo su - to root
yeah no need for sudo
;). I'm old school Linux user. since 2003
cool
also my wired NIC doesn't even show up in lspci output. I did connect wireless, so there must be firmware. I forget what the wired NIC is on here; maybe r8169. but haven't found the kernel config to grep yet. great, I'm in now. Linux dell 4.11.0-10-generic #15-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 29 15:03:41 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux. maybe I selected the wrong image?. should be the one w/out generic?. found the config /lib/modules/4.11.0-10-generic/build/.config.  can I somehow install grub properly now?
sure.  type "(blkid; cat /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu/grub.cfg) | nc termbin.com 9999"
http://termbin.com/z5y4. before you did that I issued blkid and mount. let me get you grub.cfg. /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu/grub.cfg: No such file or directory. I'll show it ... it's on /dev/sda2. no, sorry. root@dell:~# ls -l /boot/efi/EFI/. BOOT/ debian/ ubuntu/
yeah. what's inside "ubuntu" ?
nc termbin.com 9999 < /boot/efi/EFI/debian/grub.cfg --> http://termbin.com/fd7v. it's in debian
you're using ubuntu to boot though right?. that's the grub you want appearing?
ubuntu and BOOT just have efi stub(s). it is all that's on the drive. you saw my blkid?
yeah, not having grub.cfg there would give you a grub> i'd imagine
no, when I did the grub> I had to point it there. there was no debian entry in the UEFI menu iirc
Hi - did the Hoary upstream version freeze occur as expected today?
UVF happened last week
I thought it was this week - I could have sworn it was Jan 10th
for some reason my monitor jumps into standby mode every 20min, anyone know how to turn this off?
set -dpms
thanks i see it's at standby 1200 and suspend: 1800 of: 2400 indeed, thanks a lot.  do you know if this is can be triggered as well? e.g. i want to turn the screen in standby at a certain time?
So I know this channel says it's for official ubuntu releases, but is there a place I can go to ask about installing other types of linux? Or does anyone know anything about what's up with the "Furry Remixes"?. I'm mostly just curious about whether it's just like wallpapers and stuff or if it's actually a different OS
you could /msg alis list *searchterm* . i can't speak too much to furry remix but it appears it was discontinued some time ago
Oh. So then it wouldn't be smart to switch to something discontinued right?
Can anyone take a look at this http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d5593ea32 I am trying to get a custom kernel installed and it fails when I am trying to install the debian package..
i have same problem, and i use --force-all option on dpkg -i
are you installing the 2.6.29-4 kernel?
that debian systems probasbly needs something more, like nvidia driver or something
it cant be that simple lol.  are you using kernelcheck to compile yours?
i tried 2.6.29, for somereason it didnt work so i still run 2.6.28.? something.  make oldconfig, make-kpkg ...
but you had a problem installing 2.6.29?
i have had that problem sine 2..28.3
AWESOME, the --force-all option worked.. its going thru the config..
it fails on some post-install process.  and keep old kernel there too
what "make oldconfig" is that were your problem was?
what is kernelcheck
kernelcheck is a piece of software that Master Kernel wrote to auto download and compile kernels (newbie friendly).  is it safe to get rid of everything in /usr/src even my current kernel headers?
i make my kernels that old way, and then using make-kpkg to ubuntu .deb.  make mrproper is safe to do after compile in linux source dir
you should check out the forum post.. its just a scripted application.. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=311158

Hello, im looking to stop the NetworkManager daemon in 14.04 but it keeps poping back up. Anyone know how i can stop this process in a way that will allow me to start it when im ready?
sudo service Network-Manager stop ... not working ?
no bootstrap in init.d, first place i looked
try sudo service NetworkManager stop
Sure thing, ill let you know how it goes.  output: 'NetworkManager: unrecognized service'
ps -A | grep NetworkManager
Have a running process, output: 2523 ? 00:00:00 NetworkManager
it's weird that you can't stop it
When i kill it shows back up with antoher PID, so somehting is checking for it and booting it up when its missing..  Ya, in older Ubuntu releases i never had this issue
ok so I'm trying to install vbox 2.1.0 so I added the software source and did sudo apt-get install virtualbox-2.1 which worked ifne. fine*. but now I can't start it. virtualbox and virtualbox-2.1 do nothing
dont forget to install the kernel modules
I did
ok. then i have no idea.
do I need virtualbox-ose?
that's an older version of vbox
I'm using non-free. ok
-ose is the free one.  but the version of it in the repos is older
so virtualbox in the terminal should work then?
after updating today (edgy), the firewall is left down due to an error in the update! when manually $ sudo /etc/init.d/firestarter start, i get the following: eth1: error fetching interface information: Device not found. this is bad, the firewall is down due to an update bug!
: type ifconfig -a and see if you have your ethernet cards
obviously as i am chatting here on the same computer with you
eth1 is available  ?
there's just eth0 though.  i can't remember for sure, but i think i have a faulty eth0, so there should just be eth1
that's your problem  the driver is not loaded or so to make your eth1 available 
it seems like something decided eth1 should be named eth0 without my consent
what is a good GPU overclock utility for dedicated Intel cards?
not even worth trying.  pretty sure intel GPUs are locked to the system bus too, so i doubt it's an option
can i force the boost to be enable at will. *enabled
desktop?
mobile
that's a terrible, terrible idea. no ideas if you can
damn. well thanks anyways. could I try to use and MSR intel utility to alter the gpu clock?
highly doubt it
damn again
hi is it possible to pair pc with phone via buetooth, and listen on pc music from phone - using pc as stereo headset?
uhm... i think i tried doing that once
any how to ? what was the result?
does anyone here uses easytag?
A little. Not very fond of it though.
well, mine isn't working at all from months to now. why don't u use it?
When I ask it to do larger tasks it gives no indication whether it's doing anything or not. For instance, I was trying to work around a bug in Banshee by removing album cover art from MP3 files. I selected all in easytag and told it to remove them. No feedback at all, but when it was done, some had the album art removed and others didn't.
for me it doesn't do anything. i load an albun and tell it to look for info. and puuf. nothing but an error. some server returned... shish. do you know some other soft for such task?
Ok, everything keeps saying to uninstall flash, completely and reinstall. So i assume im not uninstalling it correctly.. Can anyone walk with me through uninstall and install flash, since im a dumb noob

did really no one assign a file type by hand? I have no idea what's wrong or how to check it

Hi, ive been told by someone that he was able to use a vulnerability and enter my machine, basically i have bind9 running on public port 53, how do i stop that? I dont need the server to perform as dns server. its strange though, its 14.04.5 with automatic security updates
it's not strange. security updates come days, weeks, months after the vuln has been found. security is not a single switch, it's a multi-layer solution.
then my server doesnt resolve dns queries to canonical updates repos
resolve to itself or?. using bind as local resolver?
i dont know its a setting that plesk did. im quite frustrated by the need of plesk already
offtopic here, tho'
yeah. so. i sincerely have no idea how it been configured. local resolver?
plesk is offtopic here
yes, so the problem is that the dns configuration is something i never done on a server. so i dont know how it works or what im supposed to. do. i guess if i remove bind, then how do i configure dns?
you set up the ip address of a resolver in /etc/resolv.conf
less /etc/resolv.conf. # Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8). # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
on ubuntu at least, no idea what plesk did to your system, that's why I've been saying it's offtopic here.  right so two things, is this a server? do you have a static ip or dhcp?
static. server yes. public facing website
is it hosted? by a company?
VPS on OVH. full root control
do you have something like a dns-nameservers option in your network interface config file?
ill check
/etc/network/interfaces or interfaces.d/...
doesnt seem so. interfaces.d is empty
where do you set up the static ip then?
its in /etc/network/interfaces file
ah, interfaces.d is empty, but interfaces isnt? the network config is there, right?
there are two iface. inet and inet6. statics
I hate kernel upgrades. I have to recompile so much stuff everytime I upgrade my kernel. itis annoying. you sure it doesn't say edit /etc/modules
Yep..  for adding aliases
aliases are in modules.d I think. let me check. modprobe.d even. yeah they are in /etc/modprobe.d
Ah, great
whatcha installing?. probably pop3
Going to try IrDA
lirc?
Does anyone have troubleshooting advice for extremely slow bcm43xx wireless? (Dapper) I got it working using the nickm's howto on ubuntuforums.org, but it is extremely slow and i haven't been able to find a solution.
it's limited to 11 Mbps
I realize that, but it's extremely slow as in bringing up google takes 2 or 3 minutes.
no clue. I only know about limitations of the driver, my experiences with it have convinced me not to use WLAN on Linux :P
It's about to do the same for me I think, hah.
a friend says ubuntu's color scheme is too warm, bad for the eyes. i hope this is not true...
You can always change it

Hello, I want to completely disable "Unattended Upgrades" in my laptop, sometimes when I open the lid after suspension the very first thing it does is go and start checking them, I have disabled "Automatic check for updates" in Synaptic, but it seems that it still checks for the unnatended upgrades because I can see the command running in conky taking up the CPU cycles, should I just remove the package "unattended-upgrades"? Thanks...
What is set for the autoremove setting in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades ?
It seems to be commented out, it has // at the begining of the line....  Actually the whole file seems to be commented out, all lines have the dashes.... well not dashes, actually slants "/".  So, my question is, can that oackage be removed safely?
how can i copy the text from nano to pastebin?
in X?
well terminal. using  live cd now
anyone knows about a good file sharing webserver program?
what must it do?.  ssh (sftp) is best
aright
what should i do when this hapen ? ----> mount: /media/cdrom0 is not a block device
flip /dev/devicename and /media/devicename in the command
what i do was , ---> mount -t iso9660 /media/cdrom0 /***.iso

debian:/home/# mount -t iso9660 /depot/debian-500-amd64-DVD-1.iso /cdrom |||||||||| mount: /depot/debian-500-amd64-DVD-1.iso is not a block device (maybe try `-o loop'?).  debian:/home/# mount -t iso9660 /depot/debian-500-amd64-DVD-1.iso /cdrom |||||||||| mount: /depot/debian-500-amd64-DVD-1.iso is not a block device (maybe try `-o loop'?)
Hi all. Can I share a swap partition between 2 or more linux installations? Thanks.
sure.  as long as you don't hibernate the system
is it a good choice or not in your opinion?
How do I connect to a Window 7 network share whose user doesn't have a password with Nautilus?
open a nautilus window, then hit CTRL+l to get the abbility to type your locations, then type smb://WINDOWSSHARE
did that and it just tells me "could not be found", but so quickly that I don't really think it actually tried...
did you connect to it by name, or IP? also, can other computers on the network connect to that share?
i don't have any other computer to try with, unfortunately. I tried by name, and the name is pingable. trying by IP yields the same result though.
can you check the firewall settings on the computer that you are trying to get to? make sure that windows file and print sharing are allowed.
the Windows 7 computer's firewall seems to be configured to allow file and printer sharing, and file and printer sharing is turned on.
where can I find man pages directory?
/usr/share/man/
thanks
Like, I can still ping my server but I can't access the web pages.. when that service is on.
fail2ban will log what it is finding (by default, INFO level). You can look at the logs to find out what is going on.  alternatively, you can raise the log level to gather more information
it must have been because I tried logging in too many times? I mean I thought it was supposed to return an error if I do that. is that normal for fail2ban? Like to just not even respond with anything?. if I try too many attempts that is. What's the normal behaviour supposed to be?
usually fail2ban will issue a DROP command if you over-try something it is monitoring
so DROP as in drop the socket connection to the server?
so you could, for example, look at what DROPs are currently set in iptables.  to drop the received offending packet
ah okay. Thank you
Then don't trust them, it's not like you're being forced to. You can be lazy and use apt, or not. The user has the freedom
you shouldn't restrit the user that much from choices
Go download something, and build it
how can i configure conky?. i have got a configuration file. how can i use it?
`man conky` should give you the information you seek
i have just done, but i don't understand
Let me take a look at mine, hold on..  `conky -c filename` where filename is your config file.
thx, very affable.  the file name together the path?
sudo restart ssh. restart: Unable to connect to Upstart: Failed to connect to socket /com/ubuntu/upstart: Connection refused. what does that mean?

hello. i'm having trouble with hibernate on 14.10 it's mysteriously broken (was working fine before i re-partitioned / new swap)
The only way partitioning would interfere with hibernating is if your swap is smaller than your RAM.
yes, i am aware of that
Logs?
nothing in logs but it does automatically open up a problem report after the reboot.  many fields in the problem report Details. one of them is "Problem Type: KernelOops"
Might want to scan through dmesg | less or boot.log
boot.log looks fine, dmesg looks (mostly) ok, i guess? not really sure what i'm looking for in dmseg
so i noticed that when i have xchat set to start in my 'startup applications' it won't start with the system tray icon. do apps load differently when ran from "applications startup' ? i know they're ran through terminal but... i don't quite get it
in theory it should not but in this case it is probably because by putting it there xchat ends up starting before the notification area has been created
d'aw.. that makes sense..  probably nothing I can do, right? besides just starting xchat manually
hmm there is a hackish solution that might work, then there is patching xchat ...
lets start with the hackish solution :P
do you know about the startup.txt file for xchat?
well... i know it's not in .xchat2 :P
how can i close the X session?
what do you mean
I mean, get to a shell without having X running on another
/etc/init.d/gdm stop
thanks seveas ill try that

I don't know if you figured it out, but I looked into the upstart stuff, and apparently you should set <unconvertable> start on runlevel [!0123456] <unconvertable> instead of the start on line /etc/init/ssh.conf. It will never start and not give an error, and you can still start it manually.
i put start on runlevel 0.
Can anyone please recommend me a Live CD that can fix the MBR after deleting Linux/Ubuntu partitions so that you can boot Windows XP alone?
if restoring the Windows MBR is what you really want to do, then you can practically boot up Ubuntu 11.10 live CD or USB, either is fine.. And then this command "sudo dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sda" should restore it back.. Considering that the hard drive your Windows is in the first hard disk in the first place (/dev/sda)
I am actually in the Ubuntu 10 Live CD right now. And yes the first sda is the windows
then you just have to issue the command I gave you earlier.. So I take it Windows is in /dev/sda1 partition, and inside the /dev/sda disk, right?
Correct and I just issued the command. Done!. It said 0+1 records in. 0+1 records out 404 bytes copied..  I'm going to reboot now and see if it worked.
I see. That sounds about right. I think it's actually 440 bytes :P
Nope. 404. I have it in front of me right now.
How does Ubuntu run with 2GB RAM, better than windows 8?
Yep
And better than widnows 7?
Yep
So ubuntu needs less ram than windows.
Yep
Does Ubuntu use about as much ram as windows XP?
Probably something in that neighborhood.

I changed my root partition since install. When a new kernel package gets installed, my grub config gets changed to point to the old partition. Where is the setting that dpkg looks at so I don't have to change the config after each kernel install?
looked at "groot" in /boot/grub/menu.lst yet?
is that what dpkg looks at?
hi guys, i'm trying to make a file and it fails on missing gtk/gtk.h --> what is the package for lib gtk dev? I can't seem to find one in apt-cache search
probably something like libgtk-dev. do `aptitude search libgtk`
i'm doing apt-cache search libgtk and i don't see anything, do not have aptitude but i doubt that would make a difference?
Hm.  `apt-cache search libgtk | grep "\-dev"` have you tried something like that
i really do not see anything remotely like libgtk-dev except for libgtk2.0-dev (i am on xubuntu but that shouldn't change anything)?
If I write /list I just find one Ubuntu-channel, so there got to be more. Where can I find every channel on Freenode?
theres a whole pile of them.. thousands i imagine
I'm looking for a special XBOX-channel, but I can't find any.
zambezi.... if its a group or club or something, google it
It's there a channel for xbox-scene?
zambezi look it up on their website... or google it.. #ubuntu is not the index of freeNode.
But I don't know where too look. This is homemade applications.
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=xbox-scene+irc&btnG=Google+Search&meta=
It's on another network.
zambezi, so connect to that network. !irc. ugh that won't help you
If I know how to do. I have a BNC. That's causing me problem.
how can I force ubuntu to start me an init script ini /etc/init.d on boot time?
sudo update-rc.d scriptname defaults.  if the script is correct it will run on startup.  or call it from /etc/rc.local
is scriptname the whole path? /etc/init.d/scriptname? and what is defaults?
what is the shortcut keys to jump between workspaces in gnome?

well basically i want to create a read-only .ident file which says "ident $username", probbaly could be done some other way (identd:s config i guess), just got interested about such possibility

how the heck you get "/usr/java/jre1.5.0/plugin/i386/ns7/"?
what? no the java is in /usr/java/jre1.5.0_06/bin/java

Would anybody know why I get a blank screen while booting, but the log-on screen still appears after?
what point in the boot process does the screen go black? it might be usplash
after grub.  it works fine when I use recovery mode, so I guess its something to do with the splash screen being our of sync?
did you try to turn off "quiet"? then you can see it as it boots and look for an error. Another option is to look at /var/log/dmesg. I would do both.  that is a possibility - i have a problem with my usplash and haven't got around to fixing it a second time yet
ok i'll try both of those.  yeah the operating system works fine, it's just a minor annoyance

I have a question, my headphones only work when the jack is only plugged in partially, and even then the sound comes out of my laptop speakers AND the headphones any ideas?
sounds like broken hardware prob the headphones
they work fine in windows and my fiance's mac.  I actually had the same issue with a previous pair of headphones
so you claim that its software while all you do is move the headphone plug around ?.  maybe your hardware is not supported ?
i suppose that's a possibility, but I can't help but think its a software issue as I use these headphones on windows fully plugged in without any issue....
yeah so thats weird

Hi there. Spell checker doesn't seem to be working on my ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS. There's no read underline or something whenever i type wrong.. I forgot to mention. It's in Libre Office.
what locale are you using.  for spellcheck to work, make sure you have the hunspell packages for your locale installed
how to check it ? I think it's English(India) under Tool > Language > For Selection in Libreoffice
It doesnt seem like there are any hunspell packages for en-in
It's still not working after installing hunspell packages
If you change the document language to en-Us ?
After changing to en-US it's still not working.
hmmm
Right now. I am chatting with you in Xchat. And in this xchat application Spell check is working fine. Does Libre Office uses a separate dictionary ?
heeeelp. i get FATAL: Module snd_seq_oss not found.
I get that error too when typing "modprobe snd_seq_oss", that is normal
how can i get it working?
looks like you are using an old tutorial. What are exactly trying to do?
install tuxguitar
installing it or using it?
install then use.  if i start it i get /dev/sequencer: No such file or directory
I get the same error, its irrelevant. Could it be, that tuxguitar is working properly but you just don't get sound?
well, the whole point of tuxguitar is to get sound, otherwise it's useless, every once in a while instalation succeds and i get working sound but i don't know why it wont work now.  i'm pretty sure it has something to do with the missing modules
I dont think so, that issue is usual and also happens to me on every new computer. Start tuxguitar, go in the tuxguitar settings and tell me your settings under "Sound"
tuxguitar sequencer (should have real sequencer in there), midi through port (should have java sequencer in there)
"should have"? you are confusing me
when tuxguitar works, those options are available, the java sound sequencer is included in the installation files, if i run the exact same binaries in puppy linux the real time and java options are available
Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?
do "sudo apt-get update" first amd make sure the unvierse and multiunivers repos are enabled.

Hello, channel. I'm having a little trouble with an external USB hard drive. It's fat32 and I can mount it fine as vfat, but once mounted no one but root can write to it, and even root can't seem to change perms on anything. How can I set perms on it so that anyone can write to it?
got a similar problem with my internal data drives, working on the fix now...........just need to know what a few options are before I try it on a spare drive
I'm going to try to reformat as fat16 and see if it works any better.
FAT 16 sucks in ubuntu 
Huh.
Hello everyone, I need some help determening wich version of Ubuntu 8.04 i need to get (x86 or 64Bit)
32bit procosseor or 64bit?
Yea im not sure, i know ive had issues with this laptop before.
how old is the lap top? and it's probably 32bit.  also people that have a 64bit prossor that get the 64bit Ubuntu tend to then get problems with Flash and stuff
Its pretty old, its a Compaw NX9010
ok well I am pretty sure it's 32bit
Looking up the specs it does state the processor as:
if it's pretty old it is very likely to be 32bit yes
Intel Mobile Pentium 4 3.06 GHz.  But even then im not really sure what to make of that :)\
what OS are you using at the moment?
XP :(
yes put the 1386 version of Ubuntu on it :).  you can try it from a Live CD if you haven't already
Yea i should do that. Thanks for your time. ill hit up the 86x and let you know how it went once installed
you can also try.  Ubuntu inside WIndows
Yea thats what i will try at first.  The older versions didnt go well with this video-card an all. it was a mess
can the ubuntu iso, be used with dd to usb boot?

anyone know how to bypass the following error? can not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //filesystem.squashfs
casper, squashfs... a live session?
from .iso to do an install
on a cd or thumbdrive?
on cd
maybe there's something wrong with the cd?
checksum are verified correctly.
and can you launch the live session?
same error with live session
ok, and has is worked before, or is this the first try?. it*
same error with my laptop, had to install using usb, but i dont have the usb drive any more.
if the cd gives errors on both systems, i'd say it's due to the cd
i remember when i was installing it on my laptop, someone in here said something about my bios isnt set right or that the installer doesnt read sata drives that well.
there you have it, but i cannot give advice on that. ah, 'someone' said, it's not a bios error you're getting?
not a bios but looks like a mounting error
on two different pc's?
yes, but with different disks each time. i have verified that all 5 disk are the same from the repository with checksums verified after each write.
would etx3 be a suitable file system to use as a samba share to windows?
sure
anything I should know before hand? as in possible limitations or hangups?
only thing is if u had a dual-boot system, windows can't read the ext3... but over smb it doesn't matter what filesystem you're using
no dual boot. I would be sharing from ubuntu to windows. separate machines
i have a 1680x1050 resolution, would best practice be to create a VM, install a screencasting app in the VM and record inside?
i would record outside, not inside the vm.  that's how i recorded the ones on http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/
but i have such a huge resolution. i want the panels to be visible but panning seems inconvenient. i dont think it'd be convenient to shrink to fit a smaller video size either. what should i do?
what resolution do you want to record?.  run the vm at 1024x768?
1024x768, yes that was my intention
is there anything that automounts pendrives except for gnome-settings-daemon . since i am using a customised ubuntu and using only openbox . i want to see that mounted drives are shown on my desktop
My problem: When Ubuntu was installed, I was unable to boot windows with the grub commands: root (hd0,0), chainloader +1 ... I would get the message NTLDR is missing. I found that by adding the "boot" command to the end, it would work fine. But it seems as if now, it is skipping the NTLDR, because it skips the windows boot.ini which states that I should be presented with a menu with the option for a safe boot. Any idea of how I can g
root (hd0,0) means ubuntu is at that place ?

I want to install GTK+ 3.0 through command line. what would be the appropriate apt-get install command?

how to disable totem-video-thumbnailer because its eating cpu
is that what's eathing your cpu ?. not a rootkit
sometimes it this process starts and eat the process but other times there is n't clear process doing that , so I wanna disable that one to narrow the discovery
how did you get the previous malware/bad application ?
long story please I don't wanna talk about it,sorry
fine good luck sorting out your issues.
so can you help with the totem-video-thumbnailer one?
how can i redirect wget o/p ex =>wget 'www.c.com/read.html' to directory content
can you clarify that?
in current directory i have sub directory called x ,wget 'someurl' o/p of wget should be stored in x directory
try using the -P parameter and specify a directory like: wget -P x www.c.com/read.html
no i don't want wget to save the files in directory(host) from which it was run
so you want wget to send whatever it downloads to a directory on another networked machine?
not to other machine but in same machine in different directory
anyone know the command to start smbd and nmbd?. anyone know the command to start smbd and nmbd?
sudo /etc/init.d/samba start. !breezy
will that start all the daemons?
that should start smbd and nmbd.  you can take a look inside; (try 'less /etc/init.d/samba') -- i think it starts nmbd first
it said failed. lol
then perhaps your config file is broken
lol
you did remember the 'sudo', right?
i was in root terminal
try 'restart' instead of start.  you can use 'testparm' to check your samba config file
i did. it said ok. and restart passed
ah, so it was running already
yes but not working.  my windows machine still wont recognize this comp.  do a lot of people have problems with this?
samba can be tricky to setup.  can you ping the windows machine (using IP addresses)? and vice versa?
yes
on my ubuntu-server i want to automount my external hard-drive when I connect or when my server boots and they drive is connected
put it in /etc/fstab to mount it at boot time. if you want it to automount when you connect it you will need to create a udev rule I think...
Thanks  I will look up the udev rule, duh! dont know why the fstab didnt strike me
I haven't done it myself but should be in /etc/udev/rules.d
Cool!!, thanks again.  have a question. what happens if the drive is not connected when the server boots and fstab entry is present
then you can mount it normally.
but would tbe boot fail?. i mean would the server still boot up?
"mount" will follow the rules as set up in /etc/fstab. no the boot will be fine as long as the external disk does not mount to a system critical point such as /lib for example.
Great!! U have been a great help 
nWhen I try to connect to my VNC Server via: Java Applet in the Browser, I get, a quick black screen flash then java.lang.illegalStateException: Old input was not completely processed howcome

then java or your browser are to blame.  what OS / browser / java are you running on the client system?
Ubuntu 8.10 / Firefox / Java5
64bit or 32bit?
64bit. I think it is anyways, how would I check
id look at putting 32bit on it so that you can run Sun's Java. It can help..  64bit java isnt really implemented properly yet
I am running Sun's java tho, sudo apt-get sun-java6-jdk

Anyone know of a gnome-shell extension that makes the search in overview function more like gnome-do?. If the kernel is almost "rolling stable", then the DRI libraries should be as well...
not a gs extension no, but if you want to go that route, why not install an omnilauncher like synapse or albert etc. straight-away?
well I got gnome-do now - albert I haven't tried. Does it have an equivilant in OS X? Because I feel like I remember that name...
you might be mixing that with alfred, i don't know OS X to tell whether they're related :).  synapse is in the repo's, for albert you'll need a PPA --> https://launchpad.net/~flexiondotorg/+archive/ubuntu/albert
ooo - I always like to try out new things :D THat's why I'm running Ubuntu 17.04 now. I'm kind of impressed that Ubuntu is probably the only distro that currently supports flatpaks, snaps and appimages... I've tried elementary, solus, fedora, opensuse, endless os.... or 17.10, I mean... artful
i personally like albert a lot, very configurable via plugins, impressive feature set .. yes you're right, for experimenters Ubuntu has taken on new life
I'm kind of excited... I'd like to advocate Linux to common users, but one big barrier to entry is the complexity of actually obtaining software....  if snaps, flatpaks and appimages run stable, across the board, you could choose any distro you'd want, and get your third party apps directly from the vendors website :D. At least that's what I'm hoping....  craaaaap... mono -.-
you need stereo?
no, I mean alfred - it downloaded a crapton of mono dependencies.  cus like a genius I downloaded Alfred and not Albert xD. g'doy
ah wait, i hate mono myself, you might get away with the --no-recommends switch when installing, let me check.  lol
this os x app had a similar name, like a typical name of a buttler. So I thought "alfred"....  ...which would be a better name... I'm Batman~!.  o - qt5 :P
only some qt dependencies yes
yeah, but that's fine. qt5 is actually quite slim and nimble, if utilized correctly.  kind of disappointed that I couldn't run commands with arguments... though that maybe a plugin, I guess
i just noticed i get 'albert' from https://launchpad.net/~nilarimogard/+archive/ubuntu/webupd8 PPA, has a newer version
I've got 0.11 now - I see on github it's at 0.12. with a plugin called "terminal"
correct, the webupd8 PPA has that
I'm living dangerously... got yakkety and zesty repos on my artful system :P. I'm just _waiting_ for a dependency knot...
Hello. After setting up bing nsswitch.conf and openldap+samba for a directory server, Sometime, i can't login, the boot process stuck at bind9 startup... Did you ever see that problem with 7.10 server?. hello. After setting up bind9 nsswitch.conf and openldap+samba for a directory server, Sometime, i can't login, the boot process stuck at bind9 startup... Did you ever see that problem with 7.10 server?
bind9 has nothing to do with nsswitch.conf
I know but when i bootup, if it stuck at bind, i cant login with root and it stuck
you can't login to ubuntu as root any way
But if bind start and the rest just start, i can login....  yes you can if you configure a password for root ;)
look at the syslog for bind start issues, the hang is probably it trying to contact it's masters/slave ?
anyway, that's not the point
Anyone know how to transfer files to a virtual mschine from a host one using virtual box?

no
I've made a list of png files by using 'ls -AC1 > imagelist.txt'. I want to use each filename in that text file as the input parameter for a command ./iPhonePNG How can I pipe the output to that command?
try 'cat imagelist.txt |.  cat imagelist.txt. d'oh :-).  'cat imagelist.txt | ./iPhonePNG' - sorry - I'm apparently losing my ability to type :-)
chrissharp: It just reports back, "Usage: ./iPhonePNG <input>" Which means that no filename was passed to it.. chrissharp: You think I need to use xargs in there somehow... or?
'for i in `cat imagelist.txt`; do ./iPhonePNG $i; done'.  try that
Freaking awesome... thanks!
hey all, I'd like to downgrade from ibex to hardy, is it as simple as changing 'ibex' to 'hardy' in the various sources list?
no
can you tell me what would be involved?
backup and full re-install
ok, thanks..  do all the dirs under my home folder get deleted? I read somewhere that they do not.
you have a separate home partition?
butts, no I don;t ok. Full back up it is then.
I can't unmount a drive. umount: /mnt/iso: device is busy
fuser -m /mnt/iso will tell you what's using it.
/mnt/iso: 5946c. what does that mean?
process 5946 is what's using it.
hmm. k. I am trying to install UT2k4 off an image. and, it asked for the second CD
is there anyone who can tell me how to change "document author" that i create?. i started samba somehow and now what ever i do, create new file, commit something on github, it says that i did it as "[Samba guest account]" who can i change that?
maybe change the uid for the mount
hmm, who does those two things connect?.  if i "touch somefile" than "somefile" as Owner in "file properties" have " - Samba guest account"
a file that's in a samba share, or not?
where ever i create file under this user
in ~/ ?
has same Qwner. yes
and you're sure you're not logged in as a Guest or something like that?
well, i'm, since this username that i use is "older" than samba nstallation
eh?. read http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=827310&page=2#post11188296 maybe
this "Samba guest account" started appearing since i was trying to share some folders with other windows clients in sam e network.  this "Samba guest account" started appearing since i was trying to share some folders with other windows clients in sam e network
hello, im going to install ubuntu for the first time on this laptop in five days. should i use wubi installer or burn and install from cd? (going dual boot), and is there any difference?
burn to CD if you can. You'l have to create partitions fro ubuntu though.
i had some problems with mbr when installing on other partition, but what is the difference between wubi and doing it manually?. (wubi does the same just automatically as i have understood)
wubi installs ubuntu in your windows installation. This means it uses ntfs as its file system. ext4 is better for ubuntu
Oh, i didnt know that
about mbr, if you are going to dual boot then install ubuntu's grub in mbr. it will automatically detect and add a windows boot line
Then i will try again. I will just shrink my disk and make a primary ext4 parition and shrink a swap primary partition, and just install on them? (and grub will automatically detect my win 7) , right?
it should
do i have to choose "side by side" when i run the ubuntu installer? or just choose advanced partitioning and chose the partition?. and when i do chose side by side, to i have to shrink and make the partitions before i run the installer?
advanced partitioning
i see. and both swap and the primary ext4 should both be "primary" ?
ul have to resize your windows partition if there is no space to install ubuntu.
i know, i use shrink to do that, i rezise so i get two partitions, one swap and one for the ubuntu os
not necessarily. they can be logical
what is best, logical or primary?
how many primary partitions do you have?
i hope grun picks up that i have win7 this time then ...
any of you guys played with unfs3? I'm trying to get my machines to mount nfs share but no matter how I edit /etc/hosts.{allow,deny} along with restarting networking it fails to mount because of denied permission
did you mean unfs3?
yes
Hey guys, just installed ubuntu 14.04 server edition and I can't get my static networking up. I've edited the interfaces file to include the network interface along with the netmask, gateway, and IP address. After restarting the "networking" service, I don't get anything. netstat -nr is blank as well as the route command.
For the channel's info, is this a wired connection or WIFI you are attempting to activate ?
Wired
No GUI on this server, correct ? Then show us what you have for the control file in a pastebin ' cat /etc/network/interfaces | pastebinit ' . See if we can spot an error there .
That would run fine if I was connected to the internet :). I'll just type it up real quick
Yeah, not having a connection do make relaying info a bit more challenging . But, no step for a stepper .

just out of curiousity what kind of a sound chip do you have?
I have an external usb soundcard - some texas instruments chip is on there.  but I just use the snd_usb_audio driver
brb reboot. hey . it worked =). thanks a lot for your help
What program do I have to use to change balance on my sound devices? I can't seem to do it on any settings or program I have on my menus
right click on the volume applet on the panel and you can bring up a full volume mixer
I did that, it brings up only a mic/speaker volume with no balance options
hi, I can't add any ppa, not from command line nor from Software&Updates. from commandline it just says Cannod add PPA and from Sofware&Updates when I add a ppa nothings happens.. I have 13.10 and based on what I've learned from searching about my problem I think I should mention I'm using dual boot
^^
for example for adding wine repo:. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa
that you are dualbooting should not have anything to do with a ppa.
yeah it seems so,but i searched for my problem and the only answer was dualbooting causes the problem

pulseaudio is screwing up my Ubuntu MacBook's sound (Sigmatel STAC9221) and I kill the process and Amarok can actually play a song finally. But I still can't hear it from my speakers with everything in alsamixer unmuted and turned up
Only one application can have control of the sound resources at a time under Pulse -- an unfortunate bug. You can switch everything over to ALSA an try it that way if you wish.
How do I switch it all over to ALSA?
hallo. if I want to use c/c++ plugin in eclipse what would you recommend how to install it? from software center or from eclipse itself?
better use the options within Eclipse.
are there known problems? well I tryed it from the software center and it didn't work like on my other distribution
I wouldnt know, I only develop Java in Eclipse, no other languages. If you set up the repositories in Eclipse correctly, it should be able to download the Eclipse specific parts.
allright. thank you
np :-)
may I ask another question? ^^
sure. If it has to do something with ubuntu, after all this is the ubuntu support channel.
it's more about eclipse
ok, but I think you will get more help on #eclipse. I am not a professional programmer. Just a student.
but kind of ubuntu too. anyways ... i installed open-jdk7 yesterday and alot of jdk6 packages came with it? is that normal? also after installing jdk7 und starting eclipse it tells me that I can't use jdk7 and I have to use jdk6
Can anyone help me to get ibus to function *properly* so that I can use the US-Int., w. deadkeys and enter text in Japanese using anthy?.  yes thats normal.
and that I can't use jdk7 in eclipse too?
hello! Can you tell me, how to disable this "Unlock Keyring" message every time ubuntu starts?
if your keyring password is the same as your login password, then using your password to login should avoid the prompt for the keyring password
I am using automatic login
if I want to update the wireless drivers in a laptop is "sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-precise-generic" a generic command to do that via Terminal?
whats the output of: uname -r
3.8.0-35-generic
so using the modules from kernel 3.6 would be a downgrade not an upgrade
laptops dont want to connect to the net unless they are like sitting on the router
Is there a way to view the dmesg prior to the current running session? I want to see the last thing in it before the computer locked up
/var/log/<things> kernel mostly. One good idea is to use a remote server, this way both the disk and network need to be inaccessible for you to loose your log msgs. In dire situations serial ports(non-USB) are handy.
cheake: When the system locks up everything goes down, network included, and any files being accessed at the time in a few program become 0-lengthed
hmm, I'd be suspicious about the claim that files are truncated... Though in-proper application locking can cause that effect.
They are improper applications. Believe you me, I have complained to the makers
Hey all, I have another question... I'm trying to install nVidia drivers, and it says I cant be running an X server, so my question is how do I stop it?
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
I tried ctrl+alt+backspace. didnt work. I'll try that 
can anybody explain to me why sudo chmod 644 /home/user/public_html/*.php -R doesn't seem to work as I expect...i.e. recursively from /home/user/public_html/ ???
read the manpage, use -R for recursive chmod
I thought I just did. -R is right there
is there any way to boot unutnu by using grub of fedora
edit menu.lst and put in the entry for Ubuntu?

i dont have any backup too
why not just use Ubuntu's Grub?
can i reover it ... is there any way. seb.  would it b okei if i recover ubuntu grub

hi there, I'm trying to ssh with X forwarding from win 10 (cygwin) to Ubuntu 16.04. seems I have everything in place, X server running on win 10, I ssh with -X option, I export DISPLAY variable but I still cannot get any GUI application. for example, chromium-browser returns (chromium-browser:10276): LIBDBUSMENU-GLIB-WARNING **: Unable to get session bus: Unknown or unsupported transport 'disabled' for address 'disabled:'
do you run a local X server on win10 (like xming
yes, I do.  it's called Cygwin/X Server:0.0.  I followed the tutorial here: https://x.cygwin.com/.  gparted complains like that: (gpartedbin:10786): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: :0.0
i made a sh file, it does work when in teminal i do ./Virus_Scan.sh ... How can i make it so when i use "Files" from the launcher, find the file and doubble click it and it will open in a terminal.. Cant even get that far... and now close the terminal when the process is done?
best way would be to make a .desktop launcher file for the script that way you get a proper icon.
this is for a friend who is command line uneducated
I'm running 11.10 and I'm unable to use the chmod +a command to set acl permissions - does ubuntu not support it?
is the file in a directory that is not in your home?
I have a test file in my home directory that it's failing on
try right-click on it and check the box for making it executable
running over ssh on ubuntu server
im supposed(according to a guide) to use chkconfig to do something, but i dont have chkconfig, is this normal?
you're probably reading the wrong guide
http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-Guide/simple.html is the guide im reading
use /etc/init.d/samba instead
is it an old version? or is it ubuntu specific?
I've run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and told it my preferable setting was 1600x1200@75, but even then after I restart xorg, the refresh rate is still at 60. What do I do? The xorg.conf seems to be right and had VertRefresh 50-85. Using the config tool doesn't help because it only gives me 60Hz as an option.
to get it to work for me, I had to delete the vertrefresh and horizrefresh lines from the xorg config.
I'll try that. Thanks.
my applications are opening inder wine by default. normal executable file open by default under wine. how can i change them back to open as an application?
right click open with.  right click > properties > open with
yea but how can i make it open with itself. its an standard application
go where i said and try deleting wine from that list
ok
i won't say wine is satan, but it has certainly caused more trouble than native apps, lol
it wont let me delete wine from the list.  this is an native app
is there a reason ubuntu + nvidia drivers would default to Unity 2D?
the open source drivers are no where near as well suited to the task of 3d especially with nvidia
I'm currently running the proprietary nvidia drivers, should I be running the Nouvaou drivers instead?
it may be you are running in framebuffer mode which dosen't support 3d rendering.. try running lsmod|grep fb and see if you get a result..
